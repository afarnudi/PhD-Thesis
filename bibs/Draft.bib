@article{Abreu2014InterSci,
	abstract = {We review the dynamical behavior of giant fluid vesicles in various types of external hydrodynamic flow. The interplay between stresses arising from membrane elasticity, hydrodynamic flows, and the ever present thermal fluctuations leads to a rich phenomenology. In linear flows with both rotational and elongational components, the properties of the tank-treading and tumbling motions are now well described by theoretical and numerical models. At the transition between these two regimes, strong shape deformations and amplification of thermal fluctuations generate a new regime called trembling. In this regime, the vesicle orientation oscillates quasi-periodically around the flow direction while asymmetric deformations occur. For strong enough flows, small-wavelength deformations like wrinkles are observed, similar to what happens in a suddenly reversed elongational flow. In steady elongational flow, vesicles with large excess areas deform into dumbbells at large flow rates and pearling occurs for even stronger flows. In capillary flows with parabolic flow profile, single vesicles migrate towards the center of the channel, where they adopt symmetric shapes, for two reasons. First, walls exert a hydrodynamic lift force which pushes them away. Second, shear stresses are minimal at the tip of the flow. However, symmetry is broken for vesicles with large excess areas, which flow off-center and deform asymmetrically. In suspensions, hydrodynamic interactions between vesicles add up to these two effects, making it challenging to deduce rheological properties from the dynamics of individual vesicles. Further investigations of vesicles and similar objects and their suspensions in steady or time-dependent flow will shed light on phenomena such as blood flow.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of a single fluid bilayer membrane in an external hydrodynamic flow field is considered. The deterministic equation of motion for the configuration is derived taking into account both viscous dissipation in the surrounding liquid and local incompressibility of the membrane. For quasi-spherical vesicles in shear flow, thermal fluctuations can be incorporated in a Langevin-type equation of motion for the deformation amplitudes. The solution to this equation shows an overdamped oscillatory approach to a stationary tanktreading shape. Inclination angle and ellipticity of the contour are determined as a function of excess area and shear rate. Comparisons to numerical results and experiments are discussed.},

@article{Deschamps2009PNAS,
	abstract = {An approach to quantitatively study vesicle dynamics as well as biologically-related micro-objects in a fluid flow, which is based on the combination of a dynamical trap and a control parameter, the ratio of the vorticity to the strain rate, is suggested. The flow is continuously varied between rotational, shearing, and elongational in a microfluidic 4-roll mill device, the dynamical trap, that allows scanning of the entire phase diagram of motions, i.e., tank-treading (TT), tumbling (TU), and trembling (TR), using a single vesicle even at λ = ηin/ηout = 1, where ηin and ηout are the viscosities of the inner and outer fluids. This cannot be achieved in pure shear flow, where the transition between TT and either TU or TR is attained only at λ\&gt;1. As a result, it is found that the vesicle dynamical states in a general are presented by the phase diagram in a space of only 2 dimensionless control parameters. The findings are in semiquantitative accord with the recent theory made for a quasi-spherical vesicle, although vesicles with large deviations from spherical shape were studied experimentally. The physics of TR is also uncovered.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulation is often a useful tool f or investigating the behaviour of complex systems with many degrees of freedom. Of the two major methods in this field, the Monte Carlo method and the molecular dynamics method, only the first has been applied to realistic models of lipid monolayers1--5. The term lipid monolayer is used here to describe a class of systems consisting of chain molecules on a liquid substrate, the characteristic properties of which can be summarized as follows. (1) The constituent molecules are amphipathic, that is they consist of a hydrophilic (polar) head group and one or more hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains. (2) Due to the amphipathic character of the molecules, the head groups are constrained to the plane of the substrate, whereas the tails are directed outwards from this plane. (3) The collective properties of the molecules are determined by their short-range repulsive and long-range attractive interactions and by the steric repulsion of the tails. We now present what we believe to be the first molecular dynamics simulation of a realistic model of a lipid monolayer. The model system, which has all three properties enumerated above, shows a first order phase transition from an ordered fluid-like state to a disordered, gas-like state.},

The principal feature of the method is the use of statistical techniques to recover analytical expressions for the physical variables from a known distribution of fluid elements. The equations of motion take the form of Newtonian equations for particles. Starting with a non-axisymmetric distribution of approximately 80 particles in three dimensions, the method is found to reproduce the structure of uniformly rotating and magnetic polytropes to within a few per cent. The method may be easily extended to deal with more complicated physical models.},

It combines conventional finite element methods with stochastic thermal noise, and is appropriate for simulations of large proteins and protein complexes at the mesoscale (length-scales in the range of 5 nm to 1 μm), where there is currently a paucity of modelling tools. It requires 3D volumetric information as input, which can be low resolution structural information such as cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) maps or much higher resolution atomistic co-ordinates from which volumetric information can be extracted. In this article we introduce our open source software package for performing FFEA simulations which we have released under a GPLv3 license. The software package includes a C ++ implementation of FFEA, together with tools to assist the user to set up the system from Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) or Protein Data Bank (PDB) data files. We also provide a PyMOL plugin to perform basic visualisation and additional Python tools for the analysis of FFEA simulation trajectories. This manuscript provides a basic background to the FFEA method, describing the implementation of the core mechanical model and how intermolecular interactions and the solvent environment are included within this framework. We provide prospective FFEA users with a practical overview of how to set up an FFEA simulation with reference to our publicly available online tutorials and manuals that accompany this first release of the package.},

@article{Lipowsky2014,
	abstract = {Biomimetic membranes are fluid and can undergo two different elastic deformations, bending and stretching. The bending of a membrane is primarily governed by two elastic parameters: its spontaneous (or preferred) curvature m and its bending rigidity κ. These two parameters define an intrinsic tension scale, the spontaneous tension 2κm2. Membrane stretching and compression, on the other hand, are determined by the mechanical tension acting within the membrane. For vesicle membranes, the two elastic deformations are coupled via the enclosed vesicle volume even in the absence of mechanical forces as shown here by minimizing the combined bending and stretching energy with respect to membrane area for fixed vesicle volume. As a consequence, the mechanical tension within a vesicle membrane depends on the spontaneous curvature and on the bending rigidity. This interdependence, which is difficult to grasp intuitively, is then illustrated for a variety of simple vesicle shapes. Depending on the vesicle morphology, the magnitude of the mechanical tension can be comparable to or can be much smaller than the spontaneous tension.},

We calculate deformation and adhesion energies as a function of membrane elastic parameters and adhesion strength to obtain wrapping diagrams. We predict unwrapped, partially wrapped, and completely wrapped states for prolate and oblate ellipsoids with various aspect ratios and particle sizes. In contrast to spherical particles, where partially wrapped states exist only for finite surface tensions, partially wrapped states for ellipsoids occur already for tensionless membranes. In addition, the partially wrapped states are long-lived, because of an increased energy cost for wrapping of the highly curved tips. Our results suggest a lower uptake rate of ellipsoidal particles by cells and thereby a higher virulence of tubular viruses compared with icosahedral viruses, as well as co-operative budding of ellipsoidal particles on membranes.},

They interact with plasma membranes, membranous organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, the nucleus, and intracellular and extracellular vesicles, such as autophagosomes, lysosomes, and exosomes. Extracellular vesicles have recently attracted particular attention, as they are involved in the transmission of biological signals and as regulators for biological processes. For example, exosomes, small vesicles containing proteins, mRNA, and miRNA, that are released by cells into the extracellular environment, have been suggested to participate in tumor metastasis. Furthermore, vesicles can be applied as targeted-drug-delivery systems. We systematically characterize wrapping of spherical nanoparticles that enter and exit vesicles, depending on particle size, vesicle size, vesicle reduced volume, and membrane spontaneous curvature. We predict the complex wrapping behavior, in particular for large particle-to-vesicle size ratios, where the shape changes of the free membrane contribute significantly to the deformation energy and where nanoparticle wrapping transitions and vesicle shape transitions are coupled. Partial-wrapped membrane-bound particles impose boundary conditions on the membrane that stabilise oblates and stomatocytes for particle entry, and prolates and stomatocytes for particle exit. Our results suggest that nanoparticles may stimulate autophagocytic engulfment, which would facilitate transport of the nanoparticles into lysosomes and would lead to subsequent degradation of nanoparticle-attached proteins.},

@article{GuckenbergerCPC2016,
	abstract = {One of the most challenging aspects in the accurate simulation of three-dimensional soft objects such as vesicles or biological cells is the computation of membrane bending forces. The origin of this difficulty stems from the need to numerically evaluate a fourth order derivative on the discretized surface geometry. Here we investigate six different algorithms to compute membrane bending forces, including regularly used methods as well as novel ones. All are based on the same physical model (due to Canham and Helfrich) and start from a surface discretization with flat triangles. At the same time, they differ substantially in their numerical approach. We start by comparing the numerically obtained mean curvature, the Laplace--Beltrami operator of the mean curvature and finally the surface force density to analytical results for the discocyte resting shape of a red blood cell. We find that none of the considered algorithms converges to zero error at all nodes and that for some algorithms the error even diverges. There is furthermore a pronounced influence of the mesh structure: Discretizations with more irregular triangles and node connectivity present serious difficulties for most investigated methods. To assess the behavior of the algorithms in a realistic physical application, we investigate the deformation of an initially spherical capsule in a linear shear flow at small Reynolds numbers. To exclude any influence of the flow solver, two conceptually very different solvers are employed: the Lattice--Boltzmann and the Boundary Integral Method. Despite the largely different quality of the bending algorithms when applied to the static red blood cell, we find that in the actual flow situation most algorithms give consistent results for both hydrodynamic solvers. Even so, a short review of earlier works reveals a wide scattering of reported results for, e.g., the Taylor deformation parameter. Besides the presented application to biofluidic systems, the investigated algorithms are also of high relevance to the computer graphics and numerical mathematics communities.},

	abstract = {With regard to the out-of-plane bending energy of an elastic surface membrane, capsule deformation was compared between Helfrich's isotropic continuum model and discrete models using a triangulated surface. The in-plane deformation of the membrane was modeled by the neo-Hookean or Skalak law. Two mechanical problems were numerically simulated. One was the deformation of a spherical capsule under simple shear flow and the other was the equilibrium shape of a capsule with a nonzero excess surface area, assuming the shape mechanics of a normal red blood cell. The numerical simulations demonstrated that a discrete model based on locally averaged mean curvature satisfactorily reproduces the mechanical behavior determined by Helfrich's isotropic continuum model, whereas a discrete model without the averaging exhibited different deformation behavior. Differences in the mechanical behavior between bending models may cause differences in estimated bending rigidity values of up to one order of magnitude.},

	abstract = {Nearly all molecular dynamics simulations of bacterial membranes simplify the lipid bilayer by composing it of only one or two lipids. Previous attempts of developing a model E. coli membrane have used only 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) and (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol) POPG lipids. However, an important constituent of bacterial membranes are lipids containing a cyclopropane ring within the acyl chain. We have developed a complex membrane that more accurately reflects the diverse population of lipids within E. coli cytoplasmic membranes, including lipids with a cyclic moiety. Differences between the deuterium order profile of cyclic lipids and monounsaturated lipids are observed. Furthermore, the inclusion of the cyclopropane ring decreases the surface density of the bilayer and produces a more rigid membrane as compared to POPE/POPG membranes. Additionally, the diverse acyl chain length creates a thinner bilayer which matches the hydrophobic thickness of E. coli transmembrane proteins better than the POPE/POPG bilayer. We believe that the complex lipid bilayer more accurately describes a bacterial membrane and suggest the use of it in molecular dynamic simulations rather than simple POPE/POPG membranes.},

	abstract = {Membranes in the intracellular eubacterial parasite Chlamydia trachomatis consist of the elementary body (EB) and reticular body (RB), and contain methyl branches at the iso- and anteiso-positions for some phospholipid chains. Acyl chain branching is the focus of this study. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to study bilayers of 1-13-methylpentadecanoyl-2-palmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (13-MpPPC), 1-14-methylpentadecanoyl-2-palmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (14-MpPPC), and diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine (DPhPC). These three membranes were simulated at 323K and simulations of DPhPC at 298K were also performed for better comparison to existing experimental data. Two simulations of representative EB and RB membranes of C. trachomatis composed of nine different lipid components were performed at 310.15K, to accurately reflect compositions determined by experiment and physiological conditions. Based on nearly 0.5μs of simulation data, we report that branching increases average lipid surface area, area elastic moduli, and lipid axial relaxation times, while decreasing lipid chain order. Branching also has a distinct effect on electron density profiles. Due to their high cholesterol concentrations, the EB and RB membranes were found to have relatively high area elastic moduli, which may have important biological implications.},

	abstract = {Cell membranes are far more than mere outer envelopes: remodelling of their topology is linked to vital tasks such as endocytosis, vesicle formation and protein sorting. Specialized proteins can sense and create membrane curvature, and direct membrane remodelling. Several proteins need to act together to accomplish this task, so a more generic, universal effect is thought to be at work as well. For years physicists, mathematicians, materials scientists and cell biologists have studied a possible universal effect ---attraction between proteins that is induced solely by membrane curvature. But the nature of membrane-curvature-induced interactions between proteins, and even the question of whether they are attractive or repulsive, remained obscure. Now computer simulations reveal that curvature-induced interactions can indeed be attractive, strong, and robust. Well up to the task of effecting membrane remodelling. On the cover, a virtual membrane covered with capsids during cooperative budding.},

	abstract = {Membrane lipid composition varies greatly within submembrane compartments, different organelle membranes, and also between cells of different cell stage, cell and tissue types, and organisms. Environmental factors (such as diet) also influence membrane composition. The membrane lipid composition is tightly regulated by the cell, maintaining a homeostasis that, if disrupted, can impair cell function and lead to disease. This is especially pronounced in the brain, where defects in lipid regulation are linked to various neurological diseases. The tightly regulated diversity raises questions on how complex changes in composition affect overall bilayer properties, dynamics, and lipid organization of cellular membranes. Here, we utilize recent advances in computational power and molecular dynamics force fields to develop and test a realistically complex human brain plasma membrane (PM) lipid model and extend previous work on an idealized, ``average''mammalian PM. The PMs showed both striking similarities, despite significantly different lipid composition, and interesting differences. The main differences in composition (higher cholesterol concentration and increased tail unsaturation in brain PM) appear to have opposite, yet complementary, influences on many bilayer properties. Both mixtures exhibit a range of dynamic lipid lateral inhomogeneities (``domains''). The domains can be small and transient or larger and more persistent and can correlate between the leaflets depending on lipid mixture, Brain or Average, as well as on the extent of bilayer undulations.},

	abstract = {Biological cells generate intricate structures by sculpting their membrane from within to actively sense and respond to external stimuli or to explore their environment1--4. Several pathogenic bacteria also provide examples of how localized forces strongly deform cell membranes from inside, leading to the invasion of neighbouring healthy mammalian cells5. Giant unilamellar vesicles have been successfully used as a minimal model system with which to mimic biological cells6--11, but the realization of a minimal system with localized active internal forces that can strongly deform lipid membranes from within and lead to dramatic shape changes remains challenging. Here we present a combined experimental and simulation study that demonstrates how self-propelled particles enclosed in giant unilamellar vesicles can induce a plethora of non-equilibrium shapes and active membrane fluctuations. Using confocal microscopy, in the experiments we explore the membrane response to local forces exerted by self-phoretic Janus microswimmers. To quantify dynamic membrane changes, we perform Langevin dynamics simulations of active Brownian particles enclosed in thin membrane shells modelled by dynamically triangulated surfaces. The most pronounced shape changes are observed at low and moderate particle loadings, with the formation of tether-like protrusions and highly branched, dendritic structures, whereas at high volume fractions globally deformed vesicle shapes are observed. The resulting state diagram predicts the conditions under which local internal forces generate various membrane shapes. A controlled realization of such distorted vesicle morphologies could improve the design of artificial systems such as small-scale soft robots and synthetic cells.},

	abstract = {We present a computational study of bending models for the curvature elasticity of lipid bilayer membranes that are relevant for simulations of vesicles and red blood cells. We compute bending energy and forces on triangulated meshes and evaluate and extend four well established schemes for their approximation: Kantor and Nelson (1987), J{\"u}licher (1996), Gompper and Kroll (1996) and Meyer et al. (2003), termed A, B, C, D. We present a comparative study of these four schemes on the minimal bending model and propose extensions for schemes B, C and D. These extensions incorporate the reference state and non-local energy to account for the spontaneous curvature, bilayer coupling, and area-difference elasticity models. Our results indicate that the proposed extensions enhance the schemes to account for shape transformation including budding/vesiculation as well as for non-axisymmetric shapes. We find that the extended scheme B is superior to the rest in terms of accuracy, and robustness as well as simplicity of implementation. We demonstrate the capabilities of this scheme on several benchmark problems including the budding-vesiculating process and the reproduction of the phase diagram of vesicles.},

@article{Gompper2011,
	abstract = {The deformation of thin spherical shells by applying an external pressure or by reducing the volume is studied by computer simulations and scaling arguments. The shape of the deformed shells depends on the deformation rate, the reduced volume V/V0 and the F{\"o}ppl--von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n number γ. For slow deformations the shell attains its ground state, a shell with a single indentation, whereas for large deformation rates the shell appears crumpled with many indentations. The rim of the single indentation undergoes a shape transition from smooth to polygonal for γ≃7000(ΔV/V0)−3/4. For the smooth rim the elastic energy scales like γ1/4 whereas for the polygonal indentation we find a much smaller exponent, even smaller than the exponent 1/6 that is predicted for stretching ridges. The relaxation of a shell with multiple indentations towards the ground state follows an Ostwald ripening type of pathway and depends on the compression rate and on the F{\"o}ppl--von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n number. The number of indentations decreases as a power law with time t following Nind∼t−0.375 for γ=8×103 and γ=8×104 whereas for γ=8×105 the relaxation time is longer than the simulation time.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce an insight for practical subdivision modeling to improve the quality of control mesh structures. Our approach is based on a discrete version of Gaussian-Bonnet theorem on piecewise planar manifold meshes and vertex angle deflections that determines local geometric behavior. Based on discrete Gaussian-Bonnet theorem, summation of angle deflections of all vertices is independent of mesh structure and it depends on only the topology of the mesh surface. Based on this result, it can be possible to improve organization of mesh structure of a shape according to its intended geometric structure.},

	abstract = {Block-copolymer amphiphiles have been observed to assemble into vesicles and other morphologies long known for lipids but with remarkably different properties. Coarse-grain molecular dynamics (CG-MD) is used herein to elaborate the structures and properties of diblock copolymer assemblies in water. By varying the hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio of the copolymer in line with experiment, bilayer, cylindrical and spherical micelle morphologies spontaneously assemble. Varying the molecular weight (MW) with hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio appropriate to a bilayer yields a hydrophobic core thickness that scales for large MW as a random coil polymer, in agreement with experiment. The extent of hydrophobic-segment overlap in the core increases nonlinearly with MW, indicative of chain entanglements and consistent with the dramatic decrease reported for lateral mobility in polymer vesicles. Calculated trends with MW as well as hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio thus agree with experiment, demonstrating that CG-MD simulations provide a rational design tool for diblock copolymer assemblies.},

	abstract = {We present a molecular dynamics simulation study of the self-assembly of coarse-grained lipid molecules from unbiased random initial configurations. Our lipid model is based on a well-tried CG polymer model with an additional potential that mimics the hydrophobic properties of lipid tails. We find that several stages of self-organization of lipid clusters are involved in the dynamics of bilayer formation and that the resulting equilibrium structures sensitively depend on the strength of hydrophobic interactions hc of the lipid tails and on temperature T. The obtained stable lipid membranes are quantitatively analyzed with respect to their local structure and their degree of order. At equilibrium, we obtain self-stabilizing bilayer membrane structures that exhibit a bending stiffness κB and compression modulus KC comparable to experimental measurements under physiological conditions. We present a phase diagram of our lipid model which covers a sol--gel transition, a liquid (or gel-like) phase including stable bilayer structures and vesicle formation, as well as a quasi--crystalline phase. We also determine the exact conditions for temperature T and degree of hydrophobicity hc for stable bilayer formation including closed vesicles.},

	abstract = {Design velocity fields affect every stage of the shape optimization process. The progress of the optimization process, distortion of the finite element mesh, and final shape are sensitive to the quality of velocity fields. It is important to identify and generate effective velocity fields at the beginning of the process. This paper provides several criteria to determine the effectiveness of velocity fields. A systematic approach for generating these velocity fields using deformation fields is developed. The use of interactive procedures is shown to be indispensable for ensuring the effectiveness and quality of design velocity fields. General strategies and guidelines for generating velocity fields are given. Concepts of weight-reducing, stress-reducing, form-preserving, and smooth basis shapes are presented. Normalization of velocity fields is discussed. A method for controlling mesh distortion during the shape optimization process is given based on an explicit limit on the design change to prevent the Jacobian from vanishing. Two- and three-dimensional design problems are solved.},

@article{Peskin972JourCompPhys,
	abstract = {The subject of this paper is the flow of a viscous incompressible fluid in a region containing immersed boundaries which move with the fluid and exert forces on the fluid. An example of such a boundary is the flexible leaflet of a human heart valve. It is the main achievement of the present paper that a method for solving the Navier-Stokes equations on a rectangular domain can now be applied to a problem involving this type of immersed boundary. This is accomplished by replacing the boundary by a field of force which is defined on the mesh points of the rectangular domain and which is calculated from the configuration of the boundary. In order to link the representations of the boundary and fluid, since boundary points and mesh points need not coincide, a semi-discrete analog of the δfunction is introduced. Because the boundary forces are of order h−1, and because they are sensitive to small changes in boundary configuration, they tend to produce numerical instability. This difficulty is overcome by an implicit method for calculating the boundary forces, a method which takes into account the displacements that will be produced by the boundary forces themselves. The numerical scheme is applied to the two-dimensional simulation of flow around the natural mitral valve.},

Herein, we use a numerical model of the membrane, recently developed by us, with elongated membrane inclusions possessing spontaneous directional curvatures that could be different along, and perpendicular to, the membrane's long axis. We show that, due to membrane-mediated interactions, these curvature-inducing membrane-nematogens can aggregate spontaneously, even at low concentrations, and change the local shape of the membrane. We demonstrate that for a large group of such inclusions, where the two spontaneous curvatures have equal sign, the tubular conformation and sometimes the sheet conformation of the membrane are the common equilibrium shapes. We elucidate the factors necessary for the formation of these protein lattices. Furthermore, the elastic properties of the tubes, such as their compressional stiffness and persistence length, are calculated. Finally, we discuss the possible role of nematic disclination in capping and branching of the tubular membranes.},

The coarse-grained (CG)--RBC membrane model is proposed to predict the minimum energy configuration of the RBC from the competition between lipid-bilayer bending resistance and cytoskeletal shear resistance under given reference constraints. In addition to the conventional membrane surface area, cell volume and bilayer-leaflet-area-difference constraints, a new constraint: total-membrane-curvature is proposed in the model to better predict RBC shapes in agreement with experimental observations. A quantitative evaluation of several cellular measurements including length, thickness and shape factor, is performed for the first time, between CG-RBC model predicted and three-dimensional (3D) confocal microscopy imaging generated RBC shapes at equivalent reference constraints. The validated CG-RBC membrane model is then employed to investigate the effect of reduced cell volume and elastic length scale on SDE transformation, to evaluate the RBC deformability during SDE transformation, and to identify the most probable RBC cytoskeletal reference state. The CG-RBC membrane model can predict the SDE shape behaviour under diverse shape-transforming scenarios, in-vitro RBC storage, microvascular circulation and flow through microfluidic devices.},

As flow velocity increases, a model RBC is found to transit from a nonaxisymmetric discocyteto an axisymmetric parachute shape (coaxial with the flow axis), while a fluid vesicle is found to transit from a discocyte to a prolate ellipsoid. Both shape transitions reduce the flow resistance. The critical velocities of the shape transitions are linearly dependent on the bending rigidity and on the shear modulus of the membrane. Slipper-like shapes of the RBC model are observed around the transition velocities. Our results are in good agreement with experiments on RBCs.},

@article{Li2005,
	abstract = {We present a three-dimensional computational study of whole-cell equilibrium shape and deformation of human red blood cell (RBC) using spectrin-level energetics. Random network models consisting of degree-2, 3, {\ldots}, 9 junction complexes and spectrin links are used to populate spherical and biconcave surfaces and intermediate shapes, and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations are then performed with spectrin connectivities fixed. A sphere is first filled with cytosol and gradually deflated while preserving its total surface area, until cytosol volume consistent with the real RBC is reached. The equilibrium shape is determined through energy minimization by assuming that the spectrin tetramer links satisfy the worm-like chain free-energy model. Subsequently, direct stretching by optical tweezers of the initial equilibrium shape is simulated to extract the variation of axial and transverse diameters with the stretch force. At persistence length p=7.5nm for the spectrin tetramer molecule and corresponding in-plane shear modulus μ0≈8.3μN/m, our models show reasonable agreement with recent experimental measurements on the large deformation of RBC with optical tweezers. We find that the choice of the reference state used for the in-plane elastic energy is critical for determining the equilibrium shape. If a position-independent material reference state such as a full sphere is used in defining the in-plane energy, then the bending modulus κneeds to be at least a decade larger than the widely accepted value of 2×10−19J to stabilize the biconcave shape against the cup shape. We demonstrate through detailed computations that this paradox can be avoided by invoking the physical hypothesis that the spectrin network undergoes constant remodeling to always relax the in-plane shear elastic energy to zero at any macroscopic shape, at some slow characteristic timescale. We have devised and implemented a liquefied network structure evolution algorithm that relaxes shear stress everywhere in the network and generates cytoskeleton structures that mimic experimental observations.},

@article{Canham1970,
	abstract = {The membrane of the erythrocyte is assumed responsible for the cell's curious biconcave shape. Combined theoretical and experimental results explain the biconcave shape by the principle of least total curvature of the membrane. This has been interpreted to mean that the energy of bending is minimized. The red-cell membrane is considered uniform over its surface. To accommodate the known viscoelastic properties of the membrane the expression for the bending energy of an element of area, dA, was modified to: dU ∝ (1/R12 + 1/R22) dA. R1 and R2 are the principal radii of curvature. The classical equation for the ovals of Cassini was altered to provide an expression for generating hypothetical red-cell profiles. Using the Cassini equation and the bending relation above (ignoring other membrane forces), the energy was determined for many surfaces of revolution having the same area and volume. The geometry and energy of the shape with least energy closely approximated the bending energy and geometry of the actual red-cell profile with the same area and volume. In addition to predicting the geometry of 23 cells in an isotonic medium and nine osmotically swollen cells, the bending hypothesis predicted a swelling sequence for a single cell which was similar to the observed series of Rand (1967). The existence of cup shapes frequently observed in hypotonic media fits within the framework of the bending hypothesis. The concept of bending energy adequately explains the shape of the erythrocyte.},

Building upon previous work in discrete geometry, these operators are closely related to the continuous case, guaranteeing an appropriate extension from the continuous to the discrete setting: they respect most intrinsic properties of the continuous differential operators. We show that these estimates are optimal in accuracy under mild smoothness conditions, and demonstrate their numerical quality.

	abstract = {A finite-element network model is used to investigate the influence of the topology of the red blood cell membrane skeleton on its macroscopic mechanical properties. Network topology is characterized by the number of spectrin oligomers per actin junction (phi a) and the number of spectrin dimers per self-association junction (phi s). If it is assumed that all associated spectrin is in tetrameric form, with six tetramers per actin junction (i.e., phi a = 6.0 and phi s = 2.0), then the topology of the skeleton may be modeled by a random Delaunay triangular network. Recent images of the RBC membrane skeleton suggest that the values for these topological parameters are in the range of 4.2< phi a < 5.5 and 2.1< phi s < 2.3. Model networks that simulate these realistic topologies exhibit values of the shear modulus that vary by more than an order of magnitude relative to triangular networks. This indicates that networks with relatively sparse nontriangular topologies may be needed to model the RBC membrane skeleton accurately. The model is also used to simulate skeletal alterations associated with hereditary spherocytosis and Southeast Asian ovalocytosis.},

In many mammalian cells, this 2D polymer network is connected to an underlying 3D, more rigid cytoskeleton. In this paper, we consider the pressure exerted by the thermally fluctuating, cortical network of filaments on the bilayer and predict the bilayer deformations that are induced by this pressure. We treat the filaments as flexible polymers and calculate the pressure that a network of such linear chains exerts on the bilayer; we then minimize the bilayer shape in order to predict the resulting local deformations. We compare our predictions with membrane deformations observed in electron micrographs of red blood cells. The polymer pressure along with the resulting membrane deformation can lead to compartmentalization, regulate in-plane diffusion and may influence protein sorting as well as transmit signals to the polymerization of the underlying 3D cytoskeleton.},

@article{Zeman1990,
	abstract = {The undulatory excitations (flickering) of human and camel erythrocytes were evaluated by employing the previously used flicker spectroscopy and by local measurements of the autocorrelation function K (t) of the cell thickness fluctuations using a dynamic image processing technique. By fitting theoretical and experimental flicker spectra relative values of the bending elastic modulus Kcof the membrane and of the cytoplasmic viscosity ηwere obtained. The effects of shape changes were monitored by simultaneous measurement of the average light intensity I0 passing the cells and by phase contrast microscopic observation of the cells. Evaluation of the cellular excitations in terms of the quasi-spherical model yielded values of Kc/Rinf0sup3and η·R0 (R0=equivalent sphere radius) and allowed us to account (1) for volume changes, (2) for effects of surface tension and spontaneous curvature and (3) for the non-exponential decay of K (t). From the long time decay of K (t) we obtained an upper limit of the bending elastic modulus of normal cells of Kc= 2--3 ·10−19 Nm which is an order of magnitude larger than the value found by reflection interference contrast microscopy (RICT, Kc, = 3.4 ·10−20 Nm, Zilker et al. 1987) but considerably lower than expected for a bilayer containing 50{\%} cholesterol (Kc= 5 ·10−19 Nm, Duwe et al. 1989). The major part of the paper deals with long time measurements (order of hours) of variations of the apparent Kcand ηvalues of single cells (and their reversibility) caused (1) by osmotic volume changes, (2) by discocytestomatocyte transitions induced by albumin and triflouperazine, (3) by discocyte-echinocyte transitions induced by expansion of the lipid/protein bilayer (by incubation with lipid vesicles) and by ATP-depletion in physiological NaCI solution, (4), by coupling or decoupling of bilayer and cytoskeleton using wheat germ agglutinin or erythrocytes with elliptocytosis and (5) by cross-linking the cytoskeleton using diamide. These experiments showed: (1) Kcand ηare minimal at physiological osmolarity and temperature and well controlled over a large range of these parameters. (2) Echinocyte formation does not markedly alter the apparent membrane bending stiffness. (3) During swelling the cell may undergo a transient discocyte-stomatocyte transition. (4) Strong increases of the apparent Kcand ηafter cup-formation or strong swelling and deflation are due to the effect of shear elasticity and surface tension. Our major conclusions are: (1) The erythrocyte membrane exhibits a shear free deformation regime which requires ATP for its maintenance. (2) Shape transitions may be caused by relative area changes either of the two monolayers of the lipid/protein bilayer (corresponding to the bilayer coupling hypothesis) or of the bilayer and the cytoskeleton where the latter mechanism appears to be more frequent. (3) The low bending stiffness and the shear free deformation regime are explained in terms of a slight excess area of the lipid bilayer leading to a pre-undulated surface profile. Freeze fracture electron microscopy studies provide direct evidence for a pre-undulated bilayer with an undulation wavelength of approximately 100 nm.},

	abstract = {While it is known that the shape and size of the cell nucleus change dramatically during the cell cycle, we find that the cell nucleus also exhibits subtle, but measurable, fast shape fluctuations at seconds. We find that the amplitude of these fluctuations systematically decreases during the cell cycle, thus serving as a reliable cell cycle stage indicator. Our findings show that the nucleus undergoes both thermally and actively driven undulations, the latter caused by forces from chromatin and cytoskeleton. Such undulations might affect gene regulation as well as aid the nuclear transport. Understanding the mechanism behind such undulations could prove critical for illuminating dynamic behavior of the nucleus in health and disease.The nuclear envelope (NE) presents a physical boundary between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm, sandwiched in between two highly active systems inside the cell: cytoskeleton and chromatin. NE defines the shape and size of the cell nucleus, which increases during the cell cycle, accommodating for chromosome decondensation followed by genome duplication. In this work, we study nuclear shape fluctuations at short time scales of seconds in human cells. Using spinning disk confocal microscopy, we observe fast fluctuations of the NE, visualized by fluorescently labeled lamin A, and of the chromatin globule surface (CGS) underneath the NE, visualized by fluorescently labeled histone H2B. Our findings reveal that fluctuation amplitudes of both CGS and NE monotonously decrease during the cell cycle, serving as a reliable cell cycle stage indicator. Remarkably, we find that, while CGS and NE typically fluctuate in phase, they do exhibit localized regions of out-of-phase motion, which lead to separation of NE and CGS. To explore the mechanism behind these shape fluctuations, we use biochemical perturbations. We find the shape fluctuations of CGS and NE to be both thermally and actively driven, the latter caused by forces from chromatin and cytoskeleton. Such undulations might affect gene regulation as well as contribute to the anomalously high rates of nuclear transport by, e.g., stirring of molecules next to NE, or increasing flux of molecules through the nuclear pores.},

These properties, in turn, influence the ability of RBCs to transport oxygen in circulation. Current mechanical measurements of RBCs rely on external loads. Here we apply a noncontact optical interferometric technique to quantify the thermal fluctuations of RBC membranes with 3~nm accuracy over a broad range of spatial and temporal frequencies. Combining this technique with a new mathematical model describing RBC membrane undulations, we measure the mechanical changes of RBCs as they undergo a transition from the normal discoid shape to the abnormal echinocyte and spherical shapes. These measurements indicate that, coincident with this morphological transition, there is a significant increase in the membrane{\textquoteright}s shear, area, and bending moduli. This mechanical transition can alter cell circulation and impede oxygen delivery.},

	abstract = {The thermal behaviour of membranes - surfaces of nearly vanishing tension - depends strongly on their internal state, which can be either fluid, crystalline (or polymerized), or hexatic. Thermal fluctuations have a dramatic effect on the conformation and elastic properties of membranes. We describe in this review both the continuum models of membranes which are used for theoretical analyses as well as the network models employed in simulations. The fruitful interaction between these two approaches, which has lead to recent progress in this field, is emphasized. We summarize the essential results of recent research on fluctuating membranes; in particular, the effects of bending rigidity, self-avoidance, attractive interactions, disorder, topological defects and external compression forces are discussed in detail.},

@article{Lipowsky2013,
	abstract = {Recent experimental studies on supported lipid bilayers and giant vesicles have shown that uni-lamellar membrane systems can undergo spontaneous tubulation{,} i.e.{,} can form membrane tubules or nanotubes without the application of external forces. In the case of supported lipid bilayers{,} the tube formation was induced by the adsorption of antimicrobial peptides. In the case of giant vesicles{,} spontaneous tubulation was observed after the polymer solution inside the vesicles underwent phase separation into two aqueous phases. Here{,} these processes are studied theoretically and shown to be driven by membrane tension generated by spontaneous curvature. The latter curvature is estimated for different types of adsorbing particles{,} such as ions{,} small molecules{,} and macromolecules{,} that differ in their size and in their adsorption kinetics. When the two sides of the membranes are exposed to two different concentrations of these particles{,} the membranes will acquire a spontaneous (or preferred) curvature. Particularly large spontaneous curvatures are induced by the adsorption of amphipathic peptides and BAR domain proteins. Another mechanism that induces spontaneous curvature is provided by different depletion layers in front of the two sides of the membranes. Irrespective of its molecular origin{,} a spontaneous curvature is predicted to generate a tension in weakly curved membranes{,} a `spontaneous' tension that can vary over several orders of magnitudes and can be as high as 1 mJ m−2. The concept of spontaneous tension is first used to explain the spontaneous tubulation of supported lipid bilayers when exposed to adsorbing particles. This tubulation process is energetically preferred when the spontaneous tension exceeds the adhesive strength of the underlying solid support. Furthermore{,} in the case of giant vesicles{,} the spontaneous tension can balance the osmotic pressure difference between the interior and exterior aqueous compartment. The vesicles are then able to form stable cylindrical nanotubes that protrude into the vesicle interior as observed recently for membranes in contact with two aqueous polymer phases. In these latter systems{,} the vesicle membranes are governed by two spontaneous tensions that can be directly measured since they are intimately related to the effective and intrinsic contact angles.},

It is assumed that the membrane can be characterized by a shear modulus μ, a bending modulus kc , an intrinsic mean curvature Co , and a surface viscosity ηM. The problem is formulated for the general case, and is solved analytically in the spherical limit. The observable hydrodynamics is found to depend sensitively on membrane parameters, and in particular a marked difference between solid and fluid behaviour is apparent. },

We review the distinct universality classes of membranes, determined by the local order, and the associated phase diagrams. After a discussion of several physical examples of membranes we turn to the physics of crystalline (or polymerized) membranes in which the individual monomers are rigidly bound. We discuss the phase diagram with particular attention to the dependence on the degree of self-avoidance and anisotropy. In each case we review and discuss analytic, numerical and experimental predictions of critical exponents and other key observables. Particular emphasis is given to the results obtained from the renormalization group ε-expansion. The resulting renormalization group flows and fixed points are illustrated graphically. The full technical details necessary to perform actual calculations are presented in the Appendices. We then turn to a discussion of the role of topological defects whose liberation leads to the hexatic and fluid universality classes. We finish with conclusions and a discussion of promising open directions for the future.},

	abstract = {Biomolecular membranes display rich statistical mechanical behavior. They are classified as liquid in the absence of shear elasticity in the plane of the membrane and tethered (solid) when the neighboring molecules or subunits are connected and the membranes exhibit solid-like elastic behavior in the plane of the membrane. The spectrin skeleton of red blood cells was studied as a model tethered membrane. The static structure factor of the skeletons, measured by small-angle x-ray and light scattering, was fitted with a structure factor predicted with a model calculation. The model describes tethered membrane sheets with free edges in a flat phase, which is a locally rough but globally flat membrane configuration. The fit was good for large scattering vectors. The membrane roughness exponent, zeta, defined through h alpha L zeta, where h is the average amplitude of out-of-plane fluctuations and L is the linear membrane dimension, was determined to be 0.65 +/- 0.10. Computer simulations of model red blood cell skeletons also showed this flat phase. The value for the roughness exponent, which was determined from the scaling properties of membranes of different sizes, was consistent with that from the experiments.},

	abstract = {We have obtained clear images of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton from negatively stained preparations that originate directly from the intact cell but in which the spectrin meshwork is artificially spread to allow close inspection. Our procedure requires less than 2 min at 5 degrees C in phosphate buffers. We find 200-nm-long spectrin tetramers crosslinked by junctional complexes. Each junction contains a regular 37-nm rod, probably an actin oligomer of approximately 13 monomers. Densities appear at variable places in the meshwork but distinct globules occur with great frequency 78 nm from the spectrin tetramer's junctional insertion end, very close to the known binding site for ankyrin. Most frequently, five or six spectrin tetramers insert into each junction, producing a meshwork that displays remarkably regular long range order.},

@article{Seifert1995,
	abstract = {Vesicles are closed surfaces of bilayer membranes. Their mean shapes and fluctuations are governed by the competition of curvature energy and geometrical constraints on the enclosed volume and total surface area. A scheme to calculate these fluctuations to lowest order in the ratio of temperature to bending rigidity is developed. It is shown that for fluctuations that break a symmetry of the mean shape the area constraint indeed acts like a tension whose value is given by the Lagrange multiplier used to enforce the area constraint in the first place. As a consequence, these fluctuations are also insensitive to the specific variants of the curvature model. For fluctuations that preserve the symmetry of the mean shape the role of the area constraint is more subtle. The low temperature expansion breaks down in the spherical limit where with the excess area another small parameter enters. By incorporating the area constraint in this limit exactly, the validity of the conventional approach using an effective tension for fluctuations of quasi-spherical vesicles can be assessed.},

@article{gomppernelson2012,
	abstract = {Thermal fluctuations strongly modify the large length-scale elastic behavior of cross-linked membranes, giving rise to scale-dependent elastic moduli. Whereas thermal effects in flat membranes are well understood, many natural and artificial microstructures are modeled as thin elastic shells. Shells are distinguished from flat membranes by their nonzero curvature, which provides a size-dependent coupling between the in-plane stretching modes and the out-of-plane undulations. In addition, a shell can support a pressure difference between its interior and its exterior. Little is known about the effect of thermal fluctuations on the elastic properties of shells. Here, we study the statistical mechanics of shape fluctuations in a pressurized spherical shell, using perturbation theory and Monte Carlo computer simulations, explicitly including the effects of curvature and an inward pressure. We predict novel properties of fluctuating thin shells under point indentations and pressure-induced deformations. The contribution due to thermal fluctuations increases with increasing ratio of shell radius to thickness and dominates the response when the product of this ratio and the thermal energy becomes large compared with the bending rigidity of the shell. Thermal effects are enhanced when a large uniform inward pressure acts on the shell and diverge as this pressure approaches the classical buckling transition of the shell. Our results are relevant for the elasticity and osmotic collapse of microcapsules.},

	abstract = {Lipid bilayer is the main constitutive element of biological membrane, which confines intracellular space. The mechanical properties of biological membranes may be characterized by various parameters including membrane stiffness or membrane bending rigidity, which can be measured using flicker noise spectroscopy. The flicker noise spectroscopy exploits the spontaneous thermal undulations of the membrane. The method is based on the quantitative analysis of a series of microscopic images captured during thermal membrane fluctuations. Thus, measured bending rigidity coefficient depends on the image quality as well as the selection of computational tools for image processing and mathematical model used. In this work scanning and spinning disc confocal microscopies were used to visualize fluctuating membranes of giant unilamellar vesicles. The bending rigidity coefficient was calculated for different acquisition modes, using different fluorescent probes and different image processing methods. It was shown that both imaging approaches gave similar bending coefficient values regardless of acquisition time. Using the developed methodology the effect of fluorescent probe type and aqueous phase composition on the value of the membrane bending rigidity coefficient was measured. Specifically it was found that the bending rigidity coefficient of DOPC bilayer in water is smaller than that determined for POPC membrane. It has been found that the POPC and DOPC bending rigidities coefficient in sucrose solution was lower than that in water. Fluorescence imaging makes possible the quantitative analysis of membrane mechanical properties of inhomogeneous membrane.},

	abstract = {The fluctuation spectrum of giant unilamellar vesicles is measured using a high-resolution contour detection technique. An analysis at higher q vectors than previously achievable is now possible due to technical improvements of the experimental setup and of the detection algorithm. The global fluctuation spectrum is directly fitted to deduce the membrane tension and the bending modulus of lipid membranes. Moreover, we show that the planar analysis of fluctuations is valid for spherical objects, even at low wave vectors. Corrections due to the integration time of the video camera and to the section of a 3D object by the observation plane are introduced. A precise calculation of the error bars has been done in order to provide reliable error estimate. Eventually, using this technique, we have measured bending moduli for EPC, SOPC and SOPC: CHOL membranes confirming previously published values. An interesting application of this technique can be the measurement of the fluctuation spectra for non-equilibrium membranes, such as "active membranes".},

@article{bivas1997,
	abstract = {Giant liposomes obtained by electroformation and observed by phase-contrast video microscopy show spontaneous deformations originating from Brownian motion that are characterized, in the case of quasispherical vesicles, by two parameters only, the membrane tension sigma and the bending elasticity k(c). For liposomes containing dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) or a 10 mol% cholesterol/DMPC mixture, the mechanical property of the membrane, k(c), is shown to be temperature dependent on approaching the main (thermotropic) phase transition temperature T(m). In the case of DMPC/cholesterol bilayers, we also obtained evidence for a relation between the bending elasticity and the corresponding temperature/cholesterol molecular ratio phase diagram. Comparison of DMPC/cholesterol with DMPC/cholesterol sulfate bilayers at 30 degrees C containing 30% sterol ratio shows that k(c) is independent of the surface charge density of the bilayer. Finally, bending elasticities of red blood cell (RBC) total lipid extracts lead to a very low k(c) at 37 degrees C if we refer to DMPC/cholesterol bilayers. At 25 degrees C, the very low bending elasticity of a cholesterol-free RBC lipid extract seems to be related to a phase coexistence, as it can be observed by solid-state (31)P-NMR. At the same temperature, the cholesterol-containing RBC lipid extract membrane shows an increase in the bending constant comparable to the one observed for a high cholesterol ratio in DMPC membranes.},

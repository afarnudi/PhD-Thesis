	abstract = {Impairment of intestinal epithelial barriers contributes
		  to the progression of HIV/SIV infection and leads to
		  generalized HIV-induced immune-cell activation during
		  chronic infection. Rhesus macaques are the major animal
		  model for studying HIV pathogenesis. However, detailed
		  characterization of isolated rhesus epithelial cells (ECs)
		  from intestinal tissues is not well defined. It is also not
		  well documented whether isolated ECs had any other cell
		  contaminants from intestinal tissues during the time of
		  processing that might hamper interpretation of EC
		  preparations or cultures. In this study, we identify and
		  characterize ECs based on flow cytometry and
		  immunohistochemistry methods using various enzymatic and
		  mechanical isolation techniques to enrich ECs from
		  intestinal tissues. This study shows that normal healthy
		  ECs differentially express HLA-DR, CD23, CD27, CD90, CD95
		  and IL-10R markers. Early apoptosis and upregulation of
		  ICAM-1 and HLA-DR in intestinal ECs are thought to be the
		  key features in SIV mediated enteropathy. The data suggest
		  that intestinal ECs might be playing an important role in
		  mucosal immune responses by regulating the expression of
		  different important regulatory and adhesion molecules and
		  their function.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, the developments of novel
		  technologies, such as Hi-C or GAM methods, allowed to
		  discover that chromosomes in the nucleus of mammalian cells
		  have a complex spatial organization, encompassing the
		  functional contacts between genes and regulators. In this
		  work, we review recent progresses in chromosome modeling
		  based on polymer physics to understand chromatin structure
		  and folding mechanisms. As an example, we derive in mouse
		  embryonic stem cells the full 3D structure of the Bmp7
		  locus, a genomic region that plays a key role in
		  osteoblastic differentiation. Next, as an application to
		  Neuroscience, we present the first 3D model for the mouse
		  orthologoue of the Williams--Beuren syndrome 7q11.23 human
		  locus. Deletions and duplications of the 7q11.23 region
		  generate neurodevelopmental disorders with multi-system
		  involvement and variable expressivity, and with autism.
		  Understanding the impact of such mutations on the rewiring
		  of the interactions of genes and regulators could be a new
		  key to make sense of their related diseases, with potential
		  applications in biomedicine.},

@article{abreu2014intersci,
	abstract = {We review the dynamical behavior of giant fluid vesicles
		  in various types of external hydrodynamic flow. The
		  interplay between stresses arising from membrane
		  elasticity, hydrodynamic flows, and the ever present
		  thermal fluctuations leads to a rich phenomenology. In
		  linear flows with both rotational and elongational
		  components, the properties of the tank-treading and
		  tumbling motions are now well described by theoretical and
		  numerical models. At the transition between these two
		  regimes, strong shape deformations and amplification of
		  thermal fluctuations generate a new regime called
		  trembling. In this regime, the vesicle orientation
		  oscillates quasi-periodically around the flow direction
		  while asymmetric deformations occur. For strong enough
		  flows, small-wavelength deformations like wrinkles are
		  observed, similar to what happens in a suddenly reversed
		  elongational flow. In steady elongational flow, vesicles
		  with large excess areas deform into dumbbells at large flow
		  rates and pearling occurs for even stronger flows. In
		  capillary flows with parabolic flow profile, single
		  vesicles migrate towards the center of the channel, where
		  they adopt symmetric shapes, for two reasons. First, walls
		  exert a hydrodynamic lift force which pushes them away.
		  Second, shear stresses are minimal at the tip of the flow.
		  However, symmetry is broken for vesicles with large excess
		  areas, which flow off-center and deform asymmetrically. In
		  suspensions, hydrodynamic interactions between vesicles add
		  up to these two effects, making it challenging to deduce
		  rheological properties from the dynamics of individual
		  vesicles. Further investigations of vesicles and similar
		  objects and their suspensions in steady or time-dependent
		  flow will shed light on phenomena such as blood flow.},

@article{alexandra2017pnas,
	abstract = {While it is known that the shape and size of the cell
		  nucleus change dramatically during the cell cycle, we find
		  that the cell nucleus also exhibits subtle, but measurable,
		  fast shape fluctuations at seconds. We find that the
		  amplitude of these fluctuations systematically decreases
		  during the cell cycle, thus serving as a reliable cell
		  cycle stage indicator. Our findings show that the nucleus
		  undergoes both thermally and actively driven undulations,
		  the latter caused by forces from chromatin and
		  cytoskeleton. Such undulations might affect gene regulation
		  as well as aid the nuclear transport. Understanding the
		  mechanism behind such undulations could prove critical for
		  illuminating dynamic behavior of the nucleus in health and
		  disease.The nuclear envelope (NE) presents a physical
		  boundary between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm,
		  sandwiched in between two highly active systems inside the
		  cell: cytoskeleton and chromatin. NE defines the shape and
		  size of the cell nucleus, which increases during the cell
		  cycle, accommodating for chromosome decondensation followed
		  by genome duplication. In this work, we study nuclear shape
		  fluctuations at short time scales of seconds in human
		  cells. Using spinning disk confocal microscopy, we observe
		  fast fluctuations of the NE, visualized by fluorescently
		  labeled lamin A, and of the chromatin globule surface (CGS)
		  underneath the NE, visualized by fluorescently labeled
		  histone H2B. Our findings reveal that fluctuation
		  amplitudes of both CGS and NE monotonously decrease during
		  the cell cycle, serving as a reliable cell cycle stage
		  indicator. Remarkably, we find that, while CGS and NE
		  typically fluctuate in phase, they do exhibit localized
		  regions of out-of-phase motion, which lead to separation of
		  NE and CGS. To explore the mechanism behind these shape
		  fluctuations, we use biochemical perturbations. We find the
		  shape fluctuations of CGS and NE to be both thermally and
		  actively driven, the latter caused by forces from chromatin
		  and cytoskeleton. Such undulations might affect gene
		  regulation as well as contribute to the anomalously high
		  rates of nuclear transport by, e.g., stirring of molecules
		  next to NE, or increasing flux of molecules through the
		  nuclear pores.},

	abstract = {We present a computational study of bending models for the
		  curvature elasticity of lipid bilayer membranes that are
		  relevant for simulations of vesicles and red blood cells.
		  We compute bending energy and forces on triangulated meshes
		  and evaluate and extend four well established schemes for
		  their approximation: Kantor and Nelson (1987), J{\"u}licher
		  (1996), Gompper and Kroll (1996) and Meyer et al. (2003),
		  termed A, B, C, D. We present a comparative study of these
		  four schemes on the minimal bending model and propose
		  extensions for schemes B, C and D. These extensions
		  incorporate the reference state and non-local energy to
		  account for the spontaneous curvature, bilayer coupling,
		  and area-difference elasticity models. Our results indicate
		  that the proposed extensions enhance the schemes to account
		  for shape transformation including budding/vesiculation as
		  well as for non-axisymmetric shapes. We find that the
		  extended scheme B is superior to the rest in terms of
		  accuracy, and robustness as well as simplicity of
		  implementation. We demonstrate the capabilities of this
		  scheme on several benchmark problems including the
		  budding-vesiculating process and the reproduction of the

	abstract = {Giant liposomes obtained by electroformation and observed
		  by phase-contrast video microscopy show spontaneous
		  deformations originating from Brownian motion that are
		  characterized, in the case of quasispherical vesicles, by
		  two parameters only, the membrane tension sigma and the
		  bending elasticity k(c). For liposomes containing
		  dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) or a 10 mol%
		  cholesterol/DMPC mixture, the mechanical property of the
		  membrane, k(c), is shown to be temperature dependent on
		  approaching the main (thermotropic) phase transition
		  temperature T(m). In the case of DMPC/cholesterol bilayers,
		  we also obtained evidence for a relation between the
		  bending elasticity and the corresponding
		  temperature/cholesterol molecular ratio phase diagram.
		  Comparison of DMPC/cholesterol with DMPC/cholesterol
		  sulfate bilayers at 30 degrees C containing 30% sterol
		  ratio shows that k(c) is independent of the surface charge
		  density of the bilayer. Finally, bending elasticities of
		  red blood cell (RBC) total lipid extracts lead to a very
		  low k(c) at 37 degrees C if we refer to DMPC/cholesterol
		  bilayers. At 25 degrees C, the very low bending elasticity
		  of a cholesterol-free RBC lipid extract seems to be related
		  to a phase coexistence, as it can be observed by
		  solid-state (31)P-NMR. At the same temperature, the
		  cholesterol-containing RBC lipid extract membrane shows an
		  increase in the bending constant comparable to the one

	abstract = {The arrangement of lipids and some proteins in the
		  erythrocyte membrane has been discussed. The conclusions
		  from this are listed here as a set of general guidelines
		  for the structure of membranes of higher organisms: some of
		  these rules may be wrong. But at this stage it seems useful
		  to sharpen our thoughts in this way and thereby focus
		  attention on various specific points. 1) The basis of a
		  membrane is a lipid bilayer with (i) choline phospholipids
		  and glycolipids in the external half and (ii) amino (and
		  possibly some choline) phospholipids in the cytoplasmic
		  half. There is effectively no lipid exchange across the
		  bilayer (unless enzymatically catalyzed) (68). 2) Some
		  proteins extend across the bilayer. Where this is so, they
		  will in general have carbohydrate on their surface remote
		  from the cytoplasm. This carbohydrate may prevent the
		  protein diffusing out of the membrane into the cytoplasm;
		  it acts as a lock on the protein. 3) Just as lipids do not
		  flip-flop, proteins do not rotate across the membrane.
		  Lateral motion or rotation of lipids and proteins in the
		  plane of the bilayer may be expected. 4) Most membrane
		  protein is associated with the inner, cytoplasmic, urface
		  of the membrane. Proteins are not usually associated
		  exclusively with the outer half of the lipid bilayer. 5)
		  Membrane proteins are a special class of cytoplasmic
		  proteins, not of secreted proteins.},

	abstract = {We present an experimental study of liquid rope coiling in
		  order to explore different possibilities of air bubble
		  generation in a viscous fluid. A column of viscous fluid
		  falling on a smooth solid surface exhibits different
		  behaviours{,} e.g.{,} axisymmetric stagnation flow{,}
		  coiling{,} rotatory folding{,} supercoiling{,} etc. These
		  states provide ample opportunity for air to get trapped
		  inside the body of a fluid. We investigate bubble
		  generation mechanisms by studying the instability of a
		  falling fluid rope and the characteristics of the observed
		  bubbles. Our experiments show that a viscous rope
		  undergoing supercoiling on the impact surface can{,} at
		  times{,} produce a four-branched spiral pattern of bubbles.
		  Finally{,} we provide a phase diagram illustrating the
		  bubble properties relevant to the flow rate and fall height
		  of the viscous jet. Our study provides a very simple method
		  for the generation of mono/bi-dispersed bubbles in viscous
		  fluids at high rates with an ability to tune the bubble

@article{caille2002177,
	abstract = {The cell nucleus plays a central role in the response of
		  the endothelium to mechanical forces, possibly by deforming
		  during cellular adaptation. The goal of this work was to
		  precisely quantify the mechanical properties of the
		  nucleus. Individual endothelial cells were subjected to
		  compression between glass microplates. This technique
		  allows measurement of the uniaxial force applied to the
		  cell and the resulting deformation. Measurements were made
		  on round and spread cells to rule out the influence of cell
		  morphology on the nucleus mechanical properties. Tests were
		  also carried out with nuclei isolated from cell cultures by
		  a chemical treatment. The non-linear force--deformation
		  curves indicate that round cells deform at lower forces
		  than spread cells and nuclei. Finite-element models were
		  also built with geometries adapted to actual morphometric
		  measurements of round cells, spread cells and isolated
		  nuclei. The nucleus and the cytoplasm were modeled as
		  separate homogeneous hyperelastic materials. The models
		  simulate the compression and yield the force--deformation
		  curve for a given set of elastic moduli. These parameters
		  are varied to obtain a best fit between the theoretical and
		  experimental data. The elastic modulus of the cytoplasm is
		  found to be on the order of 500N/m2 for spread and round
		  cells. The elastic modulus of the endothelial nucleus is on
		  the order of 5000N/m2 for nuclei in the cell and on the
		  order of 8000N/m2 for isolated nuclei. These results
		  represent an unambiguous measurement of the nucleus
		  mechanical properties and will be important in
		  understanding how cells perceive mechanical forces and
		  respond to them.},

@article{canham1970,
	abstract = {The membrane of the erythrocyte is assumed responsible for
		  the cell's curious biconcave shape. Combined theoretical
		  and experimental results explain the biconcave shape by the
		  principle of least total curvature of the membrane. This
		  has been interpreted to mean that the energy of bending is
		  minimized. The red-cell membrane is considered uniform over
		  its surface. To accommodate the known viscoelastic
		  properties of the membrane the expression for the bending
		  energy of an element of area, dA, was modified to: dU
		  ∝(1/R12 + 1/R22) dA. R1 and R2 are the principal radii of
		  curvature. The classical equation for the ovals of Cassini
		  was altered to provide an expression for generating
		  hypothetical red-cell profiles. Using the Cassini equation
		  and the bending relation above (ignoring other membrane
		  forces), the energy was determined for many surfaces of
		  revolution having the same area and volume. The geometry
		  and energy of the shape with least energy closely
		  approximated the bending energy and geometry of the actual
		  red-cell profile with the same area and volume. In addition
		  to predicting the geometry of 23 cells in an isotonic
		  medium and nine osmotically swollen cells, the bending
		  hypothesis predicted a swelling sequence for a single cell
		  which was similar to the observed series of Rand (1967).
		  The existence of cup shapes frequently observed in
		  hypotonic media fits within the framework of the bending
		  hypothesis. The concept of bending energy adequately
		  explains the shape of the erythrocyte.},

We calculate deformation and adhesion energies as a function of membrane elastic parameters and adhesion strength to obtain wrapping diagrams. We predict unwrapped, partially wrapped, and completely wrapped states for prolate and oblate ellipsoids with various aspect ratios and particle sizes. In contrast to spherical particles, where partially wrapped states exist only for finite surface tensions, partially wrapped states for ellipsoids occur already for tensionless membranes. In addition, the partially wrapped states are long-lived, because of an increased energy cost for wrapping of the highly curved tips. Our results suggest a lower uptake rate of ellipsoidal particles by cells and thereby a higher virulence of tubular viruses compared with icosahedral viruses, as well as co-operative budding of ellipsoidal particles on membranes.},

@article{deserno2015,
	abstract = {A fluid lipid membrane transmits stresses and torques that
		  are fully determined by its geometry. They can be described
		  by a stress- and torque-tensor, respectively, which yield
		  the force or torque per length through any curve drawn on
		  the membrane's surface. In the absence of external forces
		  or torques the surface divergence of these tensors
		  vanishes, revealing them as conserved quantities of the
		  underlying Euler-Lagrange equation for the membrane's
		  shape. This review provides a comprehensive introduction
		  into these concepts without assuming the reader's
		  familiarity with differential geometry, which instead will
		  be developed as needed, relying on little more than vector
		  calculus. The Helfrich Hamiltonian is then introduced and
		  discussed in some depth. By expressing the quest for the
		  energy-minimizing shape as a functional variation problem
		  subject to geometric constraints, as proposed by Guven
		  (2004), stress- and torque-tensors naturally emerge, and
		  their connection to the shape equation becomes evident. How
		  to reason with both tensors is then illustrated with a
		  number of simple examples, after which this review
		  concludes with four more sophisticated applications:
		  boundary conditions for adhering membranes, corrections to
		  the classical micropipette aspiration equation, membrane

	abstract = { The actin cortex is a thin cross-linked network attached
		  to the plasma membrane, which is responsible for the cell's
		  shape during migration, division, and growth. In a
		  reductionist approach, we created a minimal actin cortex
		  (MAC) attached to a lipid membrane to correlate the
		  filamentous actin architecture with its viscoelastic
		  properties. The system is composed of a supported
		  1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayer
		  doped with the receptor lipid
		  phosphatidylinositol(4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) to
		  which a constitutively active mutant of ezrin, which is a
		  direct membrane--cytoskeleton linker, is bound. The
		  formation of the MAC on the supported lipid bilayer is
		  analyzed as a function of increasing PtdIns(4,5)P2/ezrin
		  pinning points, revealing an increase in the intersections
		  between actin filaments, that is, the node density of the
		  MAC. Bead tracking microrheology on the membrane-attached
		  actin network provides information about its viscoelastic
		  properties. The results show that ezrin serves as a dynamic
		  cross-linker for the actin cortex attached to the lipid
		  bilayer and that the stiffness of the network is influenced
		  by the pinning point density, relating the plateau storage
		  modulus G0 to the node density of the MAC. },

	abstract = { Focal adhesions (FA) are bidirectional mechanical
		  biosensors that allow cells to integrate intracellular and
		  extracellular cues. Their function is tightly regulated by
		  changes in molecular composition and also by variation in
		  the spatio-temporal dynamics of FA components within this
		  structure. A closely regulated turnover of FA proteins
		  within FA sites allows cells to respond appropriately to
		  their environment, thereby impacting on cell shape and
		  function. FA protein dynamics are linked to FA maturation
		  and rates of assembly and disassembly, and have a
		  significant influence on tumor cell migration. Using the
		  FRAP technique to investigate the hidden internal dynamics
		  of FA, we identified two new regulators of FA dynamics and
		  cell migration: the Mgat5/galectin-3 lattice and tyrosine
		  phosphorylated caveolin-1 (pY14Cav1). In this short review
		  we first introduce FA and their complex dynamic behavior.
		  We then present the Mgat5/galectin-3 lattice and caveolin-1
		  and discuss their concerted role in FA dynamics, which
		  defines previously unknown, interdependent roles in tumor

	abstract = {Lipid bilayer is the main constitutive element of
		  biological membrane, which confines intracellular space.
		  The mechanical properties of biological membranes may be
		  characterized by various parameters including membrane
		  stiffness or membrane bending rigidity, which can be
		  measured using flicker noise spectroscopy. The flicker
		  noise spectroscopy exploits the spontaneous thermal
		  undulations of the membrane. The method is based on the
		  quantitative analysis of a series of microscopic images
		  captured during thermal membrane fluctuations. Thus,
		  measured bending rigidity coefficient depends on the image
		  quality as well as the selection of computational tools for
		  image processing and mathematical model used. In this work
		  scanning and spinning disc confocal microscopies were used
		  to visualize fluctuating membranes of giant unilamellar
		  vesicles. The bending rigidity coefficient was calculated
		  for different acquisition modes, using different
		  fluorescent probes and different image processing methods.
		  It was shown that both imaging approaches gave similar
		  bending coefficient values regardless of acquisition time.
		  Using the developed methodology the effect of fluorescent
		  probe type and aqueous phase composition on the value of
		  the membrane bending rigidity coefficient was measured.
		  Specifically it was found that the bending rigidity
		  coefficient of DOPC bilayer in water is smaller than that
		  determined for POPC membrane. It has been found that the
		  POPC and DOPC bending rigidities coefficient in sucrose
		  solution was lower than that in water. Fluorescence imaging

@article{falk244038,
	abstract = {The mammalian cell nucleus displays a remarkable spatial
		  segregation of active euchromatic from inactive
		  heterochromatic genomic regions. In conventional nuclei,
		  euchromatin is localized in the nuclear interior and
		  heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery. In contrast, rod
		  photoreceptors in nocturnal mammals have inverted nuclei,
		  with a dense heterochromatic core and a thin euchromatic
		  outer shell. This inverted architecture likely converts rod
		  nuclei into microlenses to facilitate nocturnal vision, and
		  may relate to the absence of particular proteins that
		  tether heterochromatin to the lamina. However, both the
		  mechanism of inversion and the role of interactions between
		  different types of chromatin and the lamina in nuclear
		  organization remain unknown. To elucidate this mechanism we
		  performed Hi-C and microscopy on cells with inverted nuclei
		  and their conventional counterparts. Strikingly, despite
		  the inversion evident in microscopy, both types of nuclei
		  display similar Hi-C maps. To resolve this paradox we
		  developed a polymer model of chromosomes and found a
		  universal mechanism that reconciles Hi-C and microscopy for
		  both inverted and conventional nuclei. Based solely on
		  attraction between heterochromatic regions, this mechanism
		  is sufficient to drive phase separation of euchromatin and
		  heterochromatin and faithfully reproduces the 3D
		  organization of inverted nuclei. When interactions between
		  heterochromatin and the lamina are added, the same model
		  recreates the conventional nuclear organization. To further
		  test our models, we eliminated lamina interactions in
		  models of conventional nuclei and found that this triggers
		  a spontaneous process of inversion that qualitatively
		  reproduces the pathway of morphological changes during
		  nuclear inversion in vivo. Together, our experiments and
		  modeling suggest that interactions among heterochromatic
		  regions are central to phase separation of the active and

	abstract = {The diffusion rate of lipids in the cell membrane is
		  reduced by a factor of 5--100 from that in artificial
		  bilayers. This slowing mechanism has puzzled cell
		  biologists for the last 25 yr. Here we address this issue
		  by studying the movement of unsaturated phospholipids in
		  rat kidney fibroblasts at the single molecule level at the
		  temporal resolution of 25 μs. The cell membrane was found
		  to be compartmentalized: phospholipids are confined within
		  230-nm-diameter (ϕ) compartments for 11 ms on average
		  before hopping to adjacent compartments. These 230-nm
		  compartments exist within greater 750-nm-ϕcompartments
		  where these phospholipids are confined for 0.33 s on
		  average. The diffusion rate within 230-nm compartments is
		  5.4 μm2/s, which is nearly as fast as that in large
		  unilamellar vesicles, indicating that the diffusion in the
		  cell membrane is reduced not because diffusion per se is
		  slow, but because the cell membrane is compartmentalized
		  with regard to lateral diffusion of phospholipids. Such
		  compartmentalization depends on the actin-based membrane
		  skeleton, but not on the extracellular matrix,
		  extracellular domains of membrane proteins, or
		  cholesterol-enriched rafts. We propose that various
		  transmembrane proteins anchored to the actin-based membrane
		  skeleton meshwork act as rows of pickets that temporarily
		  confine phospholipids.},

The coarse-grained (CG)--RBC membrane model is proposed to predict the minimum energy configuration of the RBC from the competition between lipid-bilayer bending resistance and cytoskeletal shear resistance under given reference constraints. In addition to the conventional membrane surface area, cell volume and bilayer-leaflet-area-difference constraints, a new constraint: total-membrane-curvature is proposed in the model to better predict RBC shapes in agreement with experimental observations. A quantitative evaluation of several cellular measurements including length, thickness and shape factor, is performed for the first time, between CG-RBC model predicted and three-dimensional (3D) confocal microscopy imaging generated RBC shapes at equivalent reference constraints. The validated CG-RBC membrane model is then employed to investigate the effect of reduced cell volume and elastic length scale on SDE transformation, to evaluate the RBC deformability during SDE transformation, and to identify the most probable RBC cytoskeletal reference state. The CG-RBC membrane model can predict the SDE shape behaviour under diverse shape-transforming scenarios, in-vitro RBC storage, microvascular circulation and flow through microfluidic devices.},

	abstract = {The deformation of thin spherical shells by applying an
		  external pressure or by reducing the volume is studied by
		  computer simulations and scaling arguments. The shape of
		  the deformed shells depends on the deformation rate, the
		  reduced volume V/V0 and the F{\"o}ppl--von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n
		  number γ. For slow deformations the shell attains its
		  ground state, a shell with a single indentation, whereas
		  for large deformation rates the shell appears crumpled with
		  many indentations. The rim of the single indentation
		  undergoes a shape transition from smooth to polygonal for
		  γ≃7000(ΔV/V0)−3/4. For the smooth rim the elastic
		  energy scales like γ1/4 whereas for the polygonal
		  indentation we find a much smaller exponent, even smaller
		  than the exponent 1/6 that is predicted for stretching
		  ridges. The relaxation of a shell with multiple
		  indentations towards the ground state follows an Ostwald
		  ripening type of pathway and depends on the compression
		  rate and on the F{\"o}ppl--von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n number. The
		  number of indentations decreases as a power law with time t

	abstract = {Thermal fluctuations strongly modify the large
		  length-scale elastic behavior of cross-linked membranes,
		  giving rise to scale-dependent elastic moduli. Whereas
		  thermal effects in flat membranes are well understood, many
		  natural and artificial microstructures are modeled as thin
		  elastic shells. Shells are distinguished from flat
		  membranes by their nonzero curvature, which provides a
		  size-dependent coupling between the in-plane stretching
		  modes and the out-of-plane undulations. In addition, a
		  shell can support a pressure difference between its
		  interior and its exterior. Little is known about the effect
		  of thermal fluctuations on the elastic properties of
		  shells. Here, we study the statistical mechanics of shape
		  fluctuations in a pressurized spherical shell, using
		  perturbation theory and Monte Carlo computer simulations,
		  explicitly including the effects of curvature and an inward
		  pressure. We predict novel properties of fluctuating thin
		  shells under point indentations and pressure-induced
		  deformations. The contribution due to thermal fluctuations
		  increases with increasing ratio of shell radius to
		  thickness and dominates the response when the product of
		  this ratio and the thermal energy becomes large compared
		  with the bending rigidity of the shell. Thermal effects are
		  enhanced when a large uniform inward pressure acts on the
		  shell and diverge as this pressure approaches the classical
		  buckling transition of the shell. Our results are relevant
		  for the elasticity and osmotic collapse of microcapsules.},

@article{guckenbergercpc2016,
	abstract = {One of the most challenging aspects in the accurate
		  simulation of three-dimensional soft objects such as
		  vesicles or biological cells is the computation of membrane
		  bending forces. The origin of this difficulty stems from
		  the need to numerically evaluate a fourth order derivative
		  on the discretized surface geometry. Here we investigate
		  six different algorithms to compute membrane bending
		  forces, including regularly used methods as well as novel
		  ones. All are based on the same physical model (due to
		  Canham and Helfrich) and start from a surface
		  discretization with flat triangles. At the same time, they
		  differ substantially in their numerical approach. We start
		  by comparing the numerically obtained mean curvature, the
		  Laplace--Beltrami operator of the mean curvature and
		  finally the surface force density to analytical results for
		  the discocyte resting shape of a red blood cell. We find
		  that none of the considered algorithms converges to zero
		  error at all nodes and that for some algorithms the error
		  even diverges. There is furthermore a pronounced influence
		  of the mesh structure: Discretizations with more irregular
		  triangles and node connectivity present serious
		  difficulties for most investigated methods. To assess the
		  behavior of the algorithms in a realistic physical
		  application, we investigate the deformation of an initially
		  spherical capsule in a linear shear flow at small Reynolds
		  numbers. To exclude any influence of the flow solver, two
		  conceptually very different solvers are employed: the
		  Lattice--Boltzmann and the Boundary Integral Method.
		  Despite the largely different quality of the bending
		  algorithms when applied to the static red blood cell, we
		  find that in the actual flow situation most algorithms give
		  consistent results for both hydrodynamic solvers. Even so,
		  a short review of earlier works reveals a wide scattering
		  of reported results for, e.g., the Taylor deformation
		  parameter. Besides the presented application to biofluidic
		  systems, the investigated algorithms are also of high
		  relevance to the computer graphics and numerical
		  mathematics communities.},

@article{haselwandter-christoph2013,
	abstract = {The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL)
		  is capable of transducing mechanical stimuli such as
		  membrane tension into an electrochemical response. MscL
		  provides a widely-studied model system for
		  mechanotransduction and, more generally, for how bilayer
		  mechanical properties regulate protein conformational
		  changes. Much effort has been expended on the detailed
		  experimental characterization of the molecular structure
		  and biological function of MscL. However, despite its
		  central significance, even basic issues such as the
		  physiologically relevant oligomeric states and molecular
		  structures of MscL remain a matter of debate. In
		  particular, tetrameric, pentameric, and hexameric
		  oligomeric states of MscL have been proposed, together with
		  a range of detailed molecular structures of MscL in the
		  closed and open channel states. Previous theoretical work
		  has shown that the basic phenomenology of MscL gating can
		  be understood using an elastic model describing the
		  energetic cost of the thickness deformations induced by
		  MscL in the surrounding lipid bilayer. Here, we generalize
		  this elastic model to account for the proposed oligomeric
		  states and hydrophobic shapes of MscL. We find that the
		  oligomeric state and hydrophobic shape of MscL are
		  reflected in the energetic cost of lipid bilayer
		  deformations. We make quantitative predictions pertaining
		  to the gating characteristics associated with various
		  structural models of MscL and, in particular, show that
		  different oligomeric states and hydrophobic shapes of MscL
		  yield distinct membrane contributions to the gating energy
		  and gating tension. Thus, the functional properties of MscL
		  provide a signature of the oligomeric state and hydrophobic
		  shape of MscL. Our results suggest that, in addition to the
		  hydrophobic mismatch between membrane proteins and the
		  surrounding lipid bilayer, the symmetry and shape of the
		  hydrophobic surfaces of membrane proteins play an important
		  role in the regulation of protein function by bilayer
		  membranes.},

Modeling data were correlated with cell culture experimental outcomes in order to confirm the applicability of the virtual cell model and demonstrating the ability to reflect the qualitative behavior of mesenchymal stem cells. This may provide a reliable, efficient, and fast high-throughput approach for the development of optimized substrates for a broad range of cellular applications including stem cell differentiation.},

@article{huang1986,
	abstract = {The deformation free energy of a lipid bilayer is
		  presented based on the principle of a continuum theory. For
		  small deformations, the free energy consists of a
		  layer-compression term, a splay-distortion term, and a
		  surface-tension term, equivalent to the elastic free energy
		  of a two-layer smectic liquid crystal with surface tension.
		  Minimization of the free energy leads to a differential
		  equation that, with boundary conditions, determines the
		  elastic deformation of a bilayer membrane. When a dimeric
		  gramicidin channel is formed in a membrane of thickness
		  greater than the length of the channel, the membrane
		  deformation reduces the stability of the channel.
		  Previously this effect was studied by comparing the
		  variation of channel lifetime with the surface tension of
		  bilayers (Elliott, J. R., D. Needham, J. P. Dilger, and D.
		  A. Hayden, 1983, Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 735:95-103). The
		  tension was assumed to pull a dimer for a distance z before
		  the channel loses ion conductivity. To account for the
		  data, z was found to be 18 A. With the deformation free
		  energy, the data can be accounted for with z less than or
		  approximately to 1 A, which is consistent with the breaking
		  of hydrogen bonds in a dimer dissociation. Increasing the
		  strength of lipid-protein interactions is not the only
		  consequence of the complete free energy compared with the
		  previous discussions. It also changes the shape of membrane
		  deformation around an embedded channel from convex to
		  concave, and increases the range of deformation from less
		  than 10 A to greater than 20 A. Clearly these will be
		  important factors in the general considerations of
		  lipid-protein interactions and membrane-mediated
		  interactions between proteins. In addition, thermal
		  fluctuations of a membrane are calculated; in particular,
		  we calculate the relations between the intrinsic thickness
		  and the experimentally measured values. The experimental
		  parameters of monoolein-squalene membranes are used for
		  quantitative analyses.},

@article{ingolfsson2017martini,
	abstract = {Membrane lipid composition varies greatly within
		  submembrane compartments, different organelle membranes,
		  and also between cells of different cell stage, cell and

		  diet) also influence membrane composition. The membrane
		  lipid composition is tightly regulated by the cell,
		  maintaining a homeostasis that, if disrupted, can impair
		  cell function and lead to disease. This is especially
		  pronounced in the brain, where defects in lipid regulation
		  are linked to various neurological diseases. The tightly

	abstract = {Numerical simulation is often a useful tool f or
		  investigating the behaviour of complex systems with many
		  degrees of freedom. Of the two major methods in this field,
		  the Monte Carlo method and the molecular dynamics method,
		  only the first has been applied to realistic models of
		  lipid monolayers1--5. The term lipid monolayer is used here
		  to describe a class of systems consisting of chain
		  molecules on a liquid substrate, the characteristic
		  properties of which can be summarized as follows. (1) The
		  constituent molecules are amphipathic, that is they consist
		  of a hydrophilic (polar) head group and one or more
		  hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains. (2) Due to the amphipathic
		  character of the molecules, the head groups are constrained
		  to the plane of the substrate, whereas the tails are
		  directed outwards from this plane. (3) The collective
		  properties of the molecules are determined by their
		  short-range repulsive and long-range attractive
		  interactions and by the steric repulsion of the tails. We
		  now present what we believe to be the first molecular
		  dynamics simulation of a realistic model of a lipid
		  monolayer. The model system, which has all three properties
		  enumerated above, shows a first order phase transition from

	abstract = {Abstract The nucleus is the distinguishing feature of
		  eukaryotic cells. Until recently, it was often considered
		  simply as a unique compartment containing the genetic
		  information of the cell and associated machinery, without
		  much attention to its structure and mechanical properties.
		  This article provides compelling examples that illustrate
		  how specific nuclear structures are associated with
		  important cellular functions, and how defects in nuclear
		  mechanics can cause a multitude of human diseases. During
		  differentiation, embryonic stem cells modify their nuclear
		  envelope composition and chromatin structure, resulting in
		  stiffer nuclei that reflect decreased transcriptional
		  plasticity. In contrast, neutrophils have evolved
		  characteristic lobulated nuclei that increase their
		  physical plasticity, enabling passage through narrow tissue
		  spaces in their response to inflammation. Research on
		  diverse cell types further demonstrates how induced nuclear
		  deformations during cellular compression or stretch can
		  modulate cellular function. Pathological examples of
		  disturbed nuclear mechanics include the many diseases
		  caused by mutations in the nuclear envelope proteins lamin
		  A/C and associated proteins, as well as cancer cells that
		  are often characterized by abnormal nuclear morphology. In
		  this article, we will focus on determining the functional
		  relationship between nuclear mechanics and cellular
		  (dys-)function, describing the molecular changes associated
		  with physiological and pathological examples, the resulting
		  defects in nuclear mechanics, and the effects on cellular
		  function. New insights into the close relationship between
		  nuclear mechanics and cellular organization and function
		  will yield a better understanding of normal biology and
		  will offer new clues into therapeutic approaches to the
		  various diseases associated with defective nuclear
		  mechanics. {\copyright} 2011 American Physiological

	abstract = {We present a three-dimensional computational study of
		  whole-cell equilibrium shape and deformation of human red
		  blood cell (RBC) using spectrin-level energetics. Random
		  network models consisting of degree-2, 3, {\ldots}, 9
		  junction complexes and spectrin links are used to populate
		  spherical and biconcave surfaces and intermediate shapes,
		  and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations are then
		  performed with spectrin connectivities fixed. A sphere is
		  first filled with cytosol and gradually deflated while
		  preserving its total surface area, until cytosol volume
		  consistent with the real RBC is reached. The equilibrium
		  shape is determined through energy minimization by assuming
		  that the spectrin tetramer links satisfy the worm-like
		  chain free-energy model. Subsequently, direct stretching by
		  optical tweezers of the initial equilibrium shape is
		  simulated to extract the variation of axial and transverse
		  diameters with the stretch force. At persistence length
		  p=7.5nm for the spectrin tetramer molecule and
		  corresponding in-plane shear modulus μ0≈8.3μN/m, our
		  models show reasonable agreement with recent experimental
		  measurements on the large deformation of RBC with optical
		  tweezers. We find that the choice of the reference state
		  used for the in-plane elastic energy is critical for
		  determining the equilibrium shape. If a

	abstract = {Recent experimental studies on supported lipid bilayers
		  and giant vesicles have shown that uni-lamellar membrane
		  systems can undergo spontaneous tubulation{,} i.e.{,} can
		  form membrane tubules or nanotubes without the application
		  of external forces. In the case of supported lipid
		  bilayers{,} the tube formation was induced by the
		  adsorption of antimicrobial peptides. In the case of giant
		  vesicles{,} spontaneous tubulation was observed after the
		  polymer solution inside the vesicles underwent phase
		  separation into two aqueous phases. Here{,} these processes
		  are studied theoretically and shown to be driven by
		  membrane tension generated by spontaneous curvature. The
		  latter curvature is estimated for different types of
		  adsorbing particles{,} such as ions{,} small molecules{,}
		  and macromolecules{,} that differ in their size and in
		  their adsorption kinetics. When the two sides of the
		  membranes are exposed to two different concentrations of
		  these particles{,} the membranes will acquire a spontaneous
		  (or preferred) curvature. Particularly large spontaneous
		  curvatures are induced by the adsorption of amphipathic
		  peptides and BAR domain proteins. Another mechanism that
		  induces spontaneous curvature is provided by different
		  depletion layers in front of the two sides of the
		  membranes. Irrespective of its molecular origin{,} a
		  spontaneous curvature is predicted to generate a tension in
		  weakly curved membranes{,} a `spontaneous' tension that can
		  vary over several orders of magnitudes and can be as high
		  as 1 mJ m−2. The concept of spontaneous tension is first
		  used to explain the spontaneous tubulation of supported
		  lipid bilayers when exposed to adsorbing particles. This
		  tubulation process is energetically preferred when the
		  spontaneous tension exceeds the adhesive strength of the
		  underlying solid support. Furthermore{,} in the case of
		  giant vesicles{,} the spontaneous tension can balance the
		  osmotic pressure difference between the interior and
		  exterior aqueous compartment. The vesicles are then able to
		  form stable cylindrical nanotubes that protrude into the
		  vesicle interior as observed recently for membranes in
		  contact with two aqueous polymer phases. In these latter
		  systems{,} the vesicle membranes are governed by two
		  spontaneous tensions that can be directly measured since
		  they are intimately related to the effective and intrinsic
		  contact angles.},

@article{meer2008,
	abstract = {Lipids function as essential structural components of
		  membranes, as signalling molecules, as chemical identifiers
		  of specific membranes and as energy storage molecules. The
		  synthesis of lipids is non-uniformly distributed among a
		  few cellular membranes, which requires most organelles to
		  depend on lipid transport processes to achieve their full
		  complement of lipids.Organelles differ both quantitatively
		  and qualitatively in their lipid content. In many
		  organelles, the lipid composition of separate leaflets of
		  the membrane bilayer is significantly different, which
		  produces asymmetry across the bilayer ---a situation that
		  is maintained by ATP-dependent flippases.Lipid transport
		  between and within organelles is poorly understood, but a
		  growing number of genes that are involved in these
		  processes have been unambiguously identified, and their
		  mechanisms of action are under active investigation. There
		  is clear evidence that several lipids are transported
		  between organelles by non-vesicular mechanisms that involve
		  zones of apposition between donor and acceptor
		  compartments, and macromolecular assemblies that involve
		  multiple lipids and proteins.Several dozen lipids
		  participate in intra- and intercellular signalling
		  processes. In most instances, the levels of signalling
		  molecules are exceedingly low compared with the complement
		  of structural lipids that is present in membranes.Lipids
		  adopt defined phases depending on their molecular structure
		  and the physical conditions. In lipid mixtures, two fluid
		  phases can coexist with different physical properties:
		  liquid-disordered and liquid-ordered.Liquid-ordered
		  assemblies in biomembranes, known as lipid rafts, are small
		  and transient but can coalesce and become stabilized during
		  signalling and vesicle budding. How proteins contribute to
		  phase separation and preferentially distribute into one of
		  the two different phases (or at their interface) is
		  presently unclear.},

@article{memreviewramakrishnan2014,
	abstract = {Biological membranes constitute boundaries of cells and
		  cell organelles. These membranes are soft fluid interfaces
		  whose thermodynamic states are dictated by bending moduli,
		  induced curvature fields, and thermal fluctuations.
		  Recently, there has been a flood of experimental evidence
		  highlighting active roles for these structures in many
		  cellular processes ranging from trafficking of cargo to
		  cell motility. It is believed that the local membrane
		  curvature, which is continuously altered due to its
		  interactions with myriad proteins and other macromolecules
		  attached to its surface, holds the key to the emergent
		  functionality in these cellular processes. Mechanisms at
		  the atomic scale are dictated by protein-lipid interaction
		  strength, lipid composition, lipid distribution in the
		  vicinity of the protein, shape and amino acid composition
		  of the protein, and its amino acid contents. The
		  specificity of molecular interactions together with the
		  cooperativity of multiple proteins induce and stabilize
		  complex membrane shapes at the mesoscale. These shapes span
		  a wide spectrum ranging from the spherical plasma membrane
		  to the complex cisternae of the Golgi apparatus. Mapping
		  the relation between the protein-induced deformations at
		  the molecular scale and the resulting mesoscale
		  morphologies is key to bridging cellular experiments across
		  the various length scales. In this review, we focus on the
		  theoretical and computational methods used to understand
		  the phenomenology underlying protein-driven membrane
		  remodeling. Interactions at the molecular scale can be
		  computationally probed by all atom and coarse grained
		  molecular dynamics (MD, CGMD), as well as dissipative
		  particle dynamics (DPD) simulations, which we only describe
		  in passing. We choose to focus on several continuum
		  approaches extending the Canham - Helfrich elastic energy
		  model for membranes to include the effect of
		  curvature-inducing proteins and explore the conformational
		  phase space of such systems. In this description, the
		  protein is expressed in the form of a spontaneous curvature
		  field. The approaches include field theoretical methods
		  limited to the small deformation regime, triangulated
		  surfaces and particle-based computational models to
		  investigate the large-deformation regimes observed in the
		  natural state of many biological membranes. Applications of
		  these methods to understand the properties of biological
		  membranes in homogeneous and inhomogeneous environments of
		  proteins, whose underlying curvature fields are either
		  isotropic or anisotropic, are discussed. The diversity in
		  the curvature fields elicits a rich variety of
		  morphological states, including tubes, discs, branched
		  tubes, and caveola. Mapping the thermodynamic stability of
		  these states as a function of tuning parameters such as
		  concentration and strength of curvature induction of the
		  proteins is discussed. The relative stabilities of these
		  self-organized shapes are examined through free-energy
		  calculations. The suite of methods discussed here can be
		  tailored to applications in specific cellular settings such
		  as endocytosis during cargo trafficking and tubulation of
		  filopodial structures in migrating cells, which makes these
		  methods a powerful complement to experimental studies.},

	abstract = {A thermodynamic model is proposed for describing phase
		  diagrams of mixtures of lipid bilayers and amphiphilic
		  proteins or polypeptides in water solution. The basic
		  geometrical variables of the model are the thickness of the
		  hydrophobic region of the lipid bilayer and the length of
		  the hydrophobic region of the proteins. The model
		  incorporates the elastic properties of the lipid bilayer
		  and the proteins, as well as indirect and direct
		  lipid-protein interactions expressed in terms of the
		  geometrical variables. The concept of mismatch of the
		  hydrophobic regions of the lipids and proteins is an
		  important ingredient of the model. The general phase
		  behavior is calculated using simple real solution theory.
		  The phase behavior turns out to be quite rich and is used
		  to discuss previous experiments on planar aggregations of
		  proteins in phospholipid bilayers and to propose a
		  systematic study of synthetic amphiphilic polypeptides in
		  bilayers of different thicknesses. The model is used to
		  interpret the influence of the lipid-protein interaction on
		  calorimetric measurements and on local orientational order
		  as determined by deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance.},

@article{mouritsen2011,
	abstract = {The physical properties of the lamellar lipid-bilayer
		  component of biological membranes are controlled by a host
		  of thermodynamic forces leading to overall tensionless
		  bilayers with a conspicuous lateral pressure profile and
		  build-in curvature-stress instabilities that may be
		  released locally or globally in terms of morphological
		  changes. In particular, the average molecular shape and the
		  propensity of the different lipid and protein species for
		  forming non-lamellar and curved structures are a source of
		  structural transitions and control of biological function.
		  The effects of different lipids, sterols, and proteins on
		  membrane structure are discussed and it is shown how one
		  can take advantage of the curvature-stress modulations
		  brought about by specific molecular agents, such as fatty
		  acids, lysolipids, and other amphiphilic solutes, to
		  construct intelligent drug-delivery systems that function
		  by enzymatic triggering via curvature.Practical
		  applications: The simple concept of lipid molecular shape
		  and how it impacts on the structure of lipid aggregates, in
		  particular the curvature and curvature stress in lipid
		  bilayers and liposomes, can be exploited to construct
		  liposome-based drug-delivery systems, e.g., for use as
		  nano-medicine in cancer therapy. Non-lamellar-forming
		  lysolipids and fatty acids, some of which may be designed
		  to be prodrugs, can be created by phospholipase action in
		  diseased tissues thereby providing for targeted drug
		  release and proliferation of molecular entities with
		  conical shape that break down the permeability barrier of
		  the target cells and may hence enhance efficacy.},

	abstract = {THE ionic channel associated with the acetylcholine (ACh)
		  receptor at the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscle
		  fibres is probably the best described channel in biological
		  membranes. Nevertheless, the properties of individual
		  channels are still unknown, as previous studies were
		  concerned with average population properties. Macroscopic
		  conductance fluctuations occurring in the presence of ACh
		  were analysed to provide estimates for single channel
		  conductance and mean open times1--3. The values obtained,
		  however, depended on assumptions about the shape of the
		  elementary conductance contribution---for example, that the
		  elementary contribution is a square pulse-like event2.
		  Clearly, it would be of great interest to refine techniques
		  of conductance measurement in order to resolve discrete
		  changes in conductance which are expected to occur when
		  single channels open or close. This has not been possible
		  so far because of excessive extraneous background noise. We
		  report on a more sensitive method of conductance
		  measurement, which, in appropriate conditions, reveals
		  discrete changes in conductance that show many of the

Both shape transitions reduce the flow resistance. The critical velocities of the shape transitions are linearly dependent on the bending rigidity and on the shear modulus of the membrane.

@article{nuebler196261,
	abstract = {Mammalian chromatin is organized on length scales ranging
		  from individual nucleosomes to chromosomal territories. At
		  intermediate scales two dominant features emerge in
		  interphase: (i) alternating regions (\&lt;5Mb) of active
		  and inactive chromatin that spatially segregate into
		  different compartments, and (ii) domains (\&lt;1Mb), i.e.
		  regions that preferentially interact internally, which are
		  also termed topologically associating domains (TADs) and
		  are central to gene regulation. There is growing evidence
		  that TADs are formed by active extrusion of chromatin loops
		  by cohesin, whereas compartments are established by a phase
		  separation process according to local chromatin states.
		  Here we use polymer simulations to examine how the two
		  processes, loop extrusion and compartmental segregation,
		  work collectively and potentially interfere in shaping
		  global chromosome organization. Our integrated model
		  faithfully reproduces Hi-C data from previously puzzling
		  experimental observations, where targeting of the
		  TAD-forming machinery led to changes in
		  compartmentalization. Specifically, depletion of
		  chromatin-associated cohesin reduced TADs and revealed
		  hidden, finer compartments, while increased processivity of
		  cohesin led to stronger TADs and reduced
		  compartmentalization, and depletion of the TAD boundary
		  protein, CTCF, weakened TADs while leaving compartments
		  unaffected. We reveal that these experimental perturbations
		  are special cases of a general polymer phenomenon of active
		  mixing by loop extrusion. This also predicts that
		  interference with chromatin epigenetic states or nuclear
		  volume would affect compartments but not TADs. Our results
		  suggest that chromatin organization on the megabase scale
		  emerges from competition of non-equilibrium active loop
		  extrusion and epigenetically defined compartment structure.},

	abstract = {The subject of this paper is the flow of a viscous
		  incompressible fluid in a region containing immersed
		  boundaries which move with the fluid and exert forces on
		  the fluid. An example of such a boundary is the flexible
		  leaflet of a human heart valve. It is the main achievement
		  of the present paper that a method for solving the
		  Navier-Stokes equations on a rectangular domain can now be
		  applied to a problem involving this type of immersed
		  boundary. This is accomplished by replacing the boundary by
		  a field of force which is defined on the mesh points of the
		  rectangular domain and which is calculated from the
		  configuration of the boundary. In order to link the
		  representations of the boundary and fluid, since boundary
		  points and mesh points need not coincide, a semi-discrete
		  analog of the δfunction is introduced. Because the
		  boundary forces are of order h−1, and because they are
		  sensitive to small changes in boundary configuration, they
		  tend to produce numerical instability. This difficulty is
		  overcome by an implicit method for calculating the boundary
		  forces, a method which takes into account the displacements
		  that will be produced by the boundary forces themselves.
		  The numerical scheme is applied to the two-dimensional
		  simulation of flow around the natural mitral valve.},

	abstract = { Abstract This paper considers the hydrodynamics of low
		  Reynolds number shape fluctuations of incompressible fluid
		  cells with incompressible membrane boundaries. It is
		  assumed that the membrane can be characterized by a shear
		  modulus μ, a bending modulus kc , an intrinsic mean
		  curvature Co , and a surface viscosity ηM. The problem is
		  formulated for the general case, and is solved analytically
		  in the spherical limit. The observable hydrodynamics is
		  found to depend sensitively on membrane parameters, and in
		  particular a marked difference between solid and fluid
		  behaviour is apparent. },

	abstract = {The fluctuation spectrum of giant unilamellar vesicles is
		  measured using a high-resolution contour detection
		  technique. An analysis at higher q vectors than previously
		  achievable is now possible due to technical improvements of
		  the experimental setup and of the detection algorithm. The
		  global fluctuation spectrum is directly fitted to deduce
		  the membrane tension and the bending modulus of lipid
		  membranes. Moreover, we show that the planar analysis of
		  fluctuations is valid for spherical objects, even at low
		  wave vectors. Corrections due to the integration time of
		  the video camera and to the section of a 3D object by the
		  observation plane are introduced. A precise calculation of
		  the error bars has been done in order to provide reliable
		  error estimate. Eventually, using this technique, we have
		  measured bending moduli for EPC, SOPC and SOPC: CHOL
		  membranes confirming previously published values. An
		  interesting application of this technique can be the
		  measurement of the fluctuation spectra for non-equilibrium
		  membranes, such as "active membranes".},

A systematic understanding of the relation of membrane shapes to composition, external field, environmental conditions, etc. have important biological relevance. Here we review the triangulated surface model, used in the macroscopic simulation of membranes and the associated DTMC methods. New techniques to calculate surface quantifiers, that will facilitate the study of additional in-plane orientational degrees of freedom, has been introduced. The mere presence of a polar and nematic fields, in the ordered phase, drives the ground state conformations of the membrane to a cylinder and tetrahedron, respectively.},

	abstract = {The shapes of cell membranes are largely regulated by
		  membrane-associated, curvature-active proteins. Herein, we
		  use a numerical model of the membrane, recently developed
		  by us, with elongated membrane inclusions possessing
		  spontaneous directional curvatures that could be different
		  along, and perpendicular to, the membrane's long axis. We
		  show that, due to membrane-mediated interactions, these
		  curvature-inducing membrane-nematogens can aggregate
		  spontaneously, even at low concentrations, and change the
		  local shape of the membrane. We demonstrate that for a
		  large group of such inclusions, where the two spontaneous
		  curvatures have equal sign, the tubular conformation and
		  sometimes the sheet conformation of the membrane are the
		  common equilibrium shapes. We elucidate the factors
		  necessary for the formation of these protein lattices.
		  Furthermore, the elastic properties of the tubes, such as
		  their compressional stiffness and persistence length, are
		  calculated. Finally, we discuss the possible role of
		  nematic disclination in capping and branching of the

		  domain to one of the adjacent domains at an average
		  frequency of 0.034 s-1 (the residence time within a domain
		  approximately 29 s), indicating that the plasma membrane is
		  compartmentalized for diffusion of membrane receptors and

		  These results suggest that the boundaries between

	abstract = {Vesicles are closed surfaces of bilayer membranes. Their
		  mean shapes and fluctuations are governed by the
		  competition of curvature energy and geometrical constraints
		  on the enclosed volume and total surface area. A scheme to
		  calculate these fluctuations to lowest order in the ratio
		  of temperature to bending rigidity is developed. It is
		  shown that for fluctuations that break a symmetry of the
		  mean shape the area constraint indeed acts like a tension
		  whose value is given by the Lagrange multiplier used to
		  enforce the area constraint in the first place. As a
		  consequence, these fluctuations are also insensitive to the
		  specific variants of the curvature model. For fluctuations
		  that preserve the symmetry of the mean shape the role of
		  the area constraint is more subtle. The low temperature
		  expansion breaks down in the spherical limit where with the
		  excess area another small parameter enters. By
		  incorporating the area constraint in this limit exactly,
		  the validity of the conventional approach using an
		  effective tension for fluctuations of quasi-spherical

		  Here, we create the chromosome copolymer model (CCM) by
		  representing chromosomes as a copolymer with two epigenetic

		  heterochromatin. Using novel clustering techniques, we
		  establish quantitatively that the simulated contact maps
		  and topologically associating domains (TADs) for
		  chromosomes 5 and 10 and those inferred from Hi-C
		  experiments are in good agreement. Chromatin exhibits
		  glassy dynamics with coherent motion on micron scale. The
		  broad distribution of the diffusion exponents of the
		  individual loci, which quantitatively agrees with
		  experiments, is suggestive of highly heterogeneous
		  dynamics. This is reflected in the cell-to-cell variations
		  in the contact maps. Chromosome organization is
		  hierarchical, involving the formation of chromosome
		  droplets (CDs) on genomic scale, coinciding with the TAD
		  size, followed by coalescence of the CDs, reminiscent of

@article{singer1972,
	abstract = {A fluid mosaic model is presented for the gross
		  organization and structure of the proteins and lipids of
		  biological membranes. The model is consistent with the
		  restrictions imposed by thermodynamics. In this model, the
		  proteins that are integral to the membrane are a
		  heterogeneous set of globular molecules, each arranged in
		  an amphipathic structure, that is, with the ionic and
		  highly polar groups protruding from the membrane into the
		  aqueous phase, and the nonpolar groups largely buried in
		  the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. These globular
		  molecules are partially embedded in a matrix of
		  phospholipid. The bulk of the phospholipid is organized as
		  a discontinuous, fluid bilayer, although a small fraction
		  of the lipid may interact specifically with the membrane
		  proteins. The fluid mosaic structure is therefore formally
		  analogous to a two-dimensional oriented solution of
		  integral proteins (or lipoproteins) in the viscous
		  phospholipid bilayer solvent. Recent experiments with a
		  wide variety of techniqes and several different membrane
		  systems are described, all of which abet consistent with,
		  and add much detail to, the fluid mosaic model. It
		  therefore seems appropriate to suggest possible mechanisms
		  for various membrane functions and membrane-mediated
		  phenomena in the light of the model. As examples,
		  experimentally testable mechanisms are suggested for cell
		  surface changes in malignant transformation, and for
		  cooperative effects exhibited in the interactions of
		  membranes with some specific ligands. Note added in proof:
		  Since this article was written, we have obtained electron
		  microscopic evidence (69) that the concanavalin A binding
		  sites on the membranes of SV40 virus-transformed mouse
		  fibroblasts (3T3 cells) are more clustered than the sites
		  on the membranes of normal cells, as predicted by the
		  hypothesis represented in Fig. 7B. T-here has also appeared
		  a study by Taylor et al. (70) showing the remarkable
		  effects produced on lymphocytes by the addition of
		  antibodies directed to their surface immunoglobulin
		  molecules. The antibodies induce a redistribution and
		  pinocytosis of these surface immunoglobulins, so that
		  within about 30 minutes at 37{\textdegree}C the surface
		  immunoglobulins are completely swept out of the membrane.
		  These effects do not occur, however, if the bivalent
		  antibodies are replaced by their univalent Fab fragments or
		  if the antibody experiments are carried out at
		  0{\textdegree}C instead of 37{\textdegree}C. These and
		  related results strongly indicate that the bivalent
		  antibodies produce an aggregation of the surface
		  immunoglobulin molecules in the plane of the membrane,
		  which can occur only if the immunoglobulin molecules are
		  free to diffuse in the membrane. This aggregation then
		  appears to trigger off the pinocytosis of the membrane
		  components by some unknown mechanism. Such membrane
		  transformations may be of crucial importance in the
		  induction of an antibody response to an antigen, as well as
		  iv other processes of cell differentiation.},

It combines conventional finite element methods with stochastic thermal noise, and is appropriate for simulations of large proteins and protein complexes at the mesoscale (length-scales in the range of 5 nm to 1 μm), where there is currently a paucity of modelling tools. It requires 3D volumetric information as input, which can be low resolution structural information such as cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) maps or much higher resolution atomistic co-ordinates from which volumetric information can be extracted. In this article we introduce our open source software package for performing FFEA simulations which we have released under a GPLv3 license. The software package includes a C ++ implementation of FFEA, together with tools to assist the user to set up the system from Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) or Protein Data Bank (PDB) data files. We also provide a PyMOL plugin to perform basic visualisation and additional Python tools for the analysis of FFEA simulation trajectories. This manuscript provides a basic background to the FFEA method, describing the implementation of the core mechanical model and how intermolecular interactions and the solvent environment are included within this framework. We provide prospective FFEA users with a practical overview of how to set up an FFEA simulation with reference to our publicly available online tutorials and manuals that accompany this first release of the package.},

@article{torchilin2006drugdelivery,
	abstract = {Currently used pharmaceutical nanocarriers, such as
		  liposomes, micelles, nanoemulsions, polymeric nanoparticles
		  and many others demonstrate a broad variety of useful
		  properties, such as longevity in the blood allowing for
		  their accumulation in pathological areas with compromised
		  vasculature; specific targeting to certain disease sites
		  due to various targeting ligands attached to the surface of
		  the nanocarriers; enhanced intracellular penetration with
		  the help of surface-attahced cell-penetrating molecules;
		  contrast properties due to the carrier loading with various
		  contrast materials allowing for direct carrier
		  visualization in vivo; stimuli-sensitivity allowing for
		  drug release from the carriers under certain physiological
		  conditions, and others. Some of those pharmaceutical
		  carriers have already made their way into clinic, while
		  others are still under preclinical development. What could
		  be seen much more rare, however, are the pharmaceutical
		  nanocarriers combining several from the listed abilities.
		  Long-circulating immunoliposomes capable of prolonged
		  residence in the blood and specific target recognition
		  represent one of few examples of this kind. At the same
		  time, the enginnering of multifunctional pharmaceutical
		  nanocarriers combinig several useful preoperties in one
		  particle can significantly enhance the efficacy of many
		  therapeutic and diagnostic protocols. This paper considers
		  current status and possible future directions in the
		  emerging area of multifunctional nanocarriers with primary
		  attention on the combination of such properties as
		  longevity, targetability, intracellular penetration and
		  contrast loading.},

	abstract = {With regard to the out-of-plane bending energy of an
		  elastic surface membrane, capsule deformation was compared
		  between Helfrich's isotropic continuum model and discrete
		  models using a triangulated surface. The in-plane
		  deformation of the membrane was modeled by the neo-Hookean
		  or Skalak law. Two mechanical problems were numerically
		  simulated. One was the deformation of a spherical capsule
		  under simple shear flow and the other was the equilibrium
		  shape of a capsule with a nonzero excess surface area,
		  assuming the shape mechanics of a normal red blood cell.
		  The numerical simulations demonstrated that a discrete
		  model based on locally averaged mean curvature
		  satisfactorily reproduces the mechanical behavior
		  determined by Helfrich's isotropic continuum model, whereas
		  a discrete model without the averaging exhibited different
		  deformation behavior. Differences in the mechanical
		  behavior between bending models may cause differences in
		  estimated bending rigidity values of up to one order of
		  magnitude.},

	abstract = {Biological cells generate intricate structures by
		  sculpting their membrane from within to actively sense and
		  respond to external stimuli or to explore their
		  environment1--4. Several pathogenic bacteria also provide
		  examples of how localized forces strongly deform cell
		  membranes from inside, leading to the invasion of
		  neighbouring healthy mammalian cells5. Giant unilamellar
		  vesicles have been successfully used as a minimal model
		  system with which to mimic biological cells6--11, but the
		  realization of a minimal system with localized active
		  internal forces that can strongly deform lipid membranes
		  from within and lead to dramatic shape changes remains
		  challenging. Here we present a combined experimental and
		  simulation study that demonstrates how self-propelled
		  particles enclosed in giant unilamellar vesicles can induce
		  a plethora of non-equilibrium shapes and active membrane
		  fluctuations. Using confocal microscopy, in the experiments
		  we explore the membrane response to local forces exerted by
		  self-phoretic Janus microswimmers. To quantify dynamic
		  membrane changes, we perform Langevin dynamics simulations
		  of active Brownian particles enclosed in thin membrane
		  shells modelled by dynamically triangulated surfaces. The
		  most pronounced shape changes are observed at low and
		  moderate particle loadings, with the formation of
		  tether-like protrusions and highly branched, dendritic
		  structures, whereas at high volume fractions globally
		  deformed vesicle shapes are observed. The resulting state
		  diagram predicts the conditions under which local internal
		  forces generate various membrane shapes. A controlled
		  realization of such distorted vesicle morphologies could
		  improve the design of artificial systems such as
		  small-scale soft robots and synthetic cells.},

They interact with plasma membranes, membranous organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, the nucleus, and intracellular and extracellular vesicles, such as autophagosomes, lysosomes, and exosomes. Extracellular vesicles have recently attracted particular attention, as they are involved in the transmission of biological signals and as regulators for biological processes. For example, exosomes, small vesicles containing proteins, mRNA, and miRNA, that are released by cells into the extracellular environment, have been suggested to participate in tumor metastasis. Furthermore, vesicles can be applied as targeted-drug-delivery systems. We systematically characterize wrapping of spherical nanoparticles that enter and exit vesicles, depending on particle size, vesicle size, vesicle reduced volume, and membrane spontaneous curvature. We predict the complex wrapping behavior, in particular for large particle-to-vesicle size ratios, where the shape changes of the free membrane contribute significantly to the deformation energy and where nanoparticle wrapping transitions and vesicle shape transitions are coupled. Partial-wrapped membrane-bound particles impose boundary conditions on the membrane that stabilise oblates and stomatocytes for particle entry, and prolates and stomatocytes for particle exit. Our results suggest that nanoparticles may stimulate autophagocytic engulfment, which would facilitate transport of the nanoparticles into lysosomes and would lead to subsequent degradation of nanoparticle-attached proteins.},

@article{zeman1990,
	abstract = {The undulatory excitations (flickering) of human and camel
		  erythrocytes were evaluated by employing the previously
		  used flicker spectroscopy and by local measurements of the
		  autocorrelation function K (t) of the cell thickness
		  fluctuations using a dynamic image processing technique. By
		  fitting theoretical and experimental flicker spectra
		  relative values of the bending elastic modulus Kcof the
		  membrane and of the cytoplasmic viscosity ηwere obtained.
		  The effects of shape changes were monitored by simultaneous
		  measurement of the average light intensity I0 passing the
		  cells and by phase contrast microscopic observation of the
		  cells. Evaluation of the cellular excitations in terms of
		  the quasi-spherical model yielded values of Kc/Rinf0sup3and
		  η·R0 (R0=equivalent sphere radius) and allowed us to
		  account (1) for volume changes, (2) for effects of surface
		  tension and spontaneous curvature and (3) for the
		  non-exponential decay of K (t). From the long time decay of
		  K (t) we obtained an upper limit of the bending elastic
		  modulus of normal cells of Kc= 2--3 ·10−19 Nm which is
		  an order of magnitude larger than the value found by
		  reflection interference contrast microscopy (RICT, Kc, =
		  3.4 ·10−20 Nm, Zilker et al. 1987) but considerably
		  lower than expected for a bilayer containing 50{\%}
		  cholesterol (Kc= 5 ·10−19 Nm, Duwe et al. 1989). The
		  major part of the paper deals with long time measurements
		  (order of hours) of variations of the apparent Kcand
		  ηvalues of single cells (and their reversibility) caused
		  (1) by osmotic volume changes, (2) by discocytestomatocyte
		  transitions induced by albumin and triflouperazine, (3) by
		  discocyte-echinocyte transitions induced by expansion of
		  the lipid/protein bilayer (by incubation with lipid
		  vesicles) and by ATP-depletion in physiological NaCI
		  solution, (4), by coupling or decoupling of bilayer and
		  cytoskeleton using wheat germ agglutinin or erythrocytes
		  with elliptocytosis and (5) by cross-linking the
		  cytoskeleton using diamide. These experiments showed: (1)
		  Kcand ηare minimal at physiological osmolarity and
		  temperature and well controlled over a large range of these
		  parameters. (2) Echinocyte formation does not markedly
		  alter the apparent membrane bending stiffness. (3) During
		  swelling the cell may undergo a transient
		  discocyte-stomatocyte transition. (4) Strong increases of
		  the apparent Kcand ηafter cup-formation or strong swelling
		  and deflation are due to the effect of shear elasticity and
		  surface tension. Our major conclusions are: (1) The
		  erythrocyte membrane exhibits a shear free deformation
		  regime which requires ATP for its maintenance. (2) Shape
		  transitions may be caused by relative area changes either
		  of the two monolayers of the lipid/protein bilayer
		  (corresponding to the bilayer coupling hypothesis) or of
		  the bilayer and the cytoskeleton where the latter mechanism
		  appears to be more frequent. (3) The low bending stiffness
		  and the shear free deformation regime are explained in
		  terms of a slight excess area of the lipid bilayer leading
		  to a pre-undulated surface profile. Freeze fracture
		  electron microscopy studies provide direct evidence for a
		  pre-undulated bilayer with an undulation wavelength of
		  approximately 100 nm.},

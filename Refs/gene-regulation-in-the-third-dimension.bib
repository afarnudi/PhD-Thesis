	abstract = {Analysis of the spatial organization of chromosomes reveals complex three-dimensional networks of chromosomal interactions. These interactions affect gene expression at multiple levels, including long-range control by distant enhancers and repressors, coordinated expression of genes, and modification of epigenetic states. Major challenges now include deciphering the mechanisms by which loci come together and understanding the functional consequences of these often transient associations.},

@article{DelaunayTriangulation1997,
	abstract = {STRIPACK is a Fortran 77 software package that employs an incremental algorithm to
construct a Delaunay triangulation and, optionally, a Voronoi diagram of a set of
points (nodes) on the surface of the unit sphere. The triangulation covers the convex
hull of the nodes, which need not be the entire surface, while the Voronoi diagram
covers the entire surface. The package provides a wide range of capabilities including
an efficient means of updating the triangulation with nodal additions or deletions.
For N nodes, the storage requirement for the triangulation is 13N integer storage
locations in addition to 3N nodal corrdinates. Using an off-line algorithm and work
space of size 3N, the triangulation can be constructed with time complexity O(NlogN).},

@article{Li2005,
	abstract = {We present a three-dimensional computational study of whole-cell equilibrium shape and deformation of human red blood cell (RBC) using spectrin-level energetics. Random network models consisting of degree-2, 3, {\ldots}, 9 junction complexes and spectrin links are used to populate spherical and biconcave surfaces and intermediate shapes, and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations are then performed with spectrin connectivities fixed. A sphere is first filled with cytosol and gradually deflated while preserving its total surface area, until cytosol volume consistent with the real RBC is reached. The equilibrium shape is determined through energy minimization by assuming that the spectrin tetramer links satisfy the worm-like chain free-energy model. Subsequently, direct stretching by optical tweezers of the initial equilibrium shape is simulated to extract the variation of axial and transverse diameters with the stretch force. At persistence length p=7.5nm for the spectrin tetramer molecule and corresponding in-plane shear modulus μ0≈8.3μN/m, our models show reasonable agreement with recent experimental measurements on the large deformation of RBC with optical tweezers. We find that the choice of the reference state used for the in-plane elastic energy is critical for determining the equilibrium shape. If a position-independent material reference state such as a full sphere is used in defining the in-plane energy, then the bending modulus κneeds to be at least a decade larger than the widely accepted value of 2×10−19J to stabilize the biconcave shape against the cup shape. We demonstrate through detailed computations that this paradox can be avoided by invoking the physical hypothesis that the spectrin network undergoes constant remodeling to always relax the in-plane shear elastic energy to zero at any macroscopic shape, at some slow characteristic timescale. We have devised and implemented a liquefied network structure evolution algorithm that relaxes shear stress everywhere in the network and generates cytoskeleton structures that mimic experimental observations.},

@article{Schindler2016BBA,
	abstract = {We present a molecular dynamics simulation study of the self-assembly of coarse-grained lipid molecules from unbiased random initial configurations. Our lipid model is based on a well-tried CG polymer model with an additional potential that mimics the hydrophobic properties of lipid tails. We find that several stages of self-organization of lipid clusters are involved in the dynamics of bilayer formation and that the resulting equilibrium structures sensitively depend on the strength of hydrophobic interactions hc of the lipid tails and on temperature T. The obtained stable lipid membranes are quantitatively analyzed with respect to their local structure and their degree of order. At equilibrium, we obtain self-stabilizing bilayer membrane structures that exhibit a bending stiffness κB and compression modulus KC comparable to experimental measurements under physiological conditions. We present a phase diagram of our lipid model which covers a sol--gel transition, a liquid (or gel-like) phase including stable bilayer structures and vesicle formation, as well as a quasi--crystalline phase. We also determine the exact conditions for temperature T and degree of hydrophobicity hc for stable bilayer formation including closed vesicles.},

@article{Discher2004NatMat,
	abstract = {Block-copolymer amphiphiles have been observed to assemble into vesicles and other morphologies long known for lipids but with remarkably different properties. Coarse-grain molecular dynamics (CG-MD) is used herein to elaborate the structures and properties of diblock copolymer assemblies in water. By varying the hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio of the copolymer in line with experiment, bilayer, cylindrical and spherical micelle morphologies spontaneously assemble. Varying the molecular weight (MW) with hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio appropriate to a bilayer yields a hydrophobic core thickness that scales for large MW as a random coil polymer, in agreement with experiment. The extent of hydrophobic-segment overlap in the core increases nonlinearly with MW, indicative of chain entanglements and consistent with the dramatic decrease reported for lateral mobility in polymer vesicles. Calculated trends with MW as well as hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio thus agree with experiment, demonstrating that CG-MD simulations provide a rational design tool for diblock copolymer assemblies.},

The coarse-grained (CG)--RBC membrane model is proposed to predict the minimum energy configuration of the RBC from the competition between lipid-bilayer bending resistance and cytoskeletal shear resistance under given reference constraints. In addition to the conventional membrane surface area, cell volume and bilayer-leaflet-area-difference constraints, a new constraint: total-membrane-curvature is proposed in the model to better predict RBC shapes in agreement with experimental observations. A quantitative evaluation of several cellular measurements including length, thickness and shape factor, is performed for the first time, between CG-RBC model predicted and three-dimensional (3D) confocal microscopy imaging generated RBC shapes at equivalent reference constraints. The validated CG-RBC membrane model is then employed to investigate the effect of reduced cell volume and elastic length scale on SDE transformation, to evaluate the RBC deformability during SDE transformation, and to identify the most probable RBC cytoskeletal reference state. The CG-RBC membrane model can predict the SDE shape behaviour under diverse shape-transforming scenarios, in-vitro RBC storage, microvascular circulation and flow through microfluidic devices.},

	abstract = {The shapes of cell membranes are largely regulated by membrane-associated, curvature-active proteins. Herein, we use a numerical model of the membrane, recently developed by us, with elongated membrane inclusions possessing spontaneous directional curvatures that could be different along, and perpendicular to, the membrane's long axis. We show that, due to membrane-mediated interactions, these curvature-inducing membrane-nematogens can aggregate spontaneously, even at low concentrations, and change the local shape of the membrane. We demonstrate that for a large group of such inclusions, where the two spontaneous curvatures have equal sign, the tubular conformation and sometimes the sheet conformation of the membrane are the common equilibrium shapes. We elucidate the factors necessary for the formation of these protein lattices. Furthermore, the elastic properties of the tubes, such as their compressional stiffness and persistence length, are calculated. Finally, we discuss the possible role of nematic disclination in capping and branching of the tubular membranes.},

New techniques to calculate surface quantifiers, that will facilitate the study of additional in-plane orientational degrees of freedom, has been introduced. The mere presence of a polar and nematic fields, in the ordered phase, drives the ground state conformations of the membrane to a cylinder and tetrahedron, respectively.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a unified and consistent set of flexible tools to approximate important geometric attributes, including normal vectors and curvatures on arbitrary triangle meshes. We present a consistent derivation of these first and second order differential properties using averaging Voronoi cells and the mixed Finite-Element/Finite-Volume method, and compare them to existing formulations. Building upon previous work in discrete geometry, these operators are closely related to the continuous case, guaranteeing an appropriate extension from the continuous to the discrete setting: they respect most intrinsic properties of the continuous differential operators. We show that these estimates are optimal in accuracy under mild smoothness conditions, and demonstrate their numerical quality. We also present applications of these operators, such as mesh smoothing, enhancement, and quality checking, and show results of denoising in higher dimensions, such as for tensor images.},

Thermal fluctuations have a dramatic effect on the conformation and elastic properties of membranes. We describe in this review both the continuum models of membranes which are used for theoretical analyses as well as the network models employed in simulations. The fruitful interaction between these two approaches, which has lead to recent progress in this field, is emphasized. We summarize the essential results of recent research on fluctuating membranes; in particular, the effects of bending rigidity, self-avoidance, attractive interactions, disorder, topological defects and external compression forces are discussed in detail.},

The anchored polymers exert an entropically induced pressure on the membrane which is calculated explicitly using a small-gradient expansion. Likewise, we are able to determine both the shape profile of the membrane, which approaches a cone-like shape close to the anchor and a catenoid far away from it, and the profile of the induced mean curvature. We also consider membranes decorated by many polymers and identify two coverage regimes; one of which is governed by polymer/membrane and the other by polymer/polymer interactions.},

Clustering of membrane componentsleads to larger domains which can grow up to a certain maximal size andthen undergo a budding process. The maximal domain size depends on theinterplay of spontaneous curvature, bending rigidity, and line tension.It is argued that this interplay governs the formation of bothclathrin-coated buds and caveolae. Finally, membrane adhesion often leadsto domain formation within the contact zone.},

	abstract = {Lipids function as essential structural components of membranes, as signalling molecules, as chemical identifiers of specific membranes and as energy storage molecules. The synthesis of lipids is non-uniformly distributed among a few cellular membranes, which requires most organelles to depend on lipid transport processes to achieve their full complement of lipids.Organelles differ both quantitatively and qualitatively in their lipid content. In many organelles, the lipid composition of separate leaflets of the membrane bilayer is significantly different, which produces asymmetry across the bilayer ---a situation that is maintained by ATP-dependent flippases.Lipid transport between and within organelles is poorly understood, but a growing number of genes that are involved in these processes have been unambiguously identified, and their mechanisms of action are under active investigation. There is clear evidence that several lipids are transported between organelles by non-vesicular mechanisms that involve zones of apposition between donor and acceptor compartments, and macromolecular assemblies that involve multiple lipids and proteins.Several dozen lipids participate in intra- and intercellular signalling processes. In most instances, the levels of signalling molecules are exceedingly low compared with the complement of structural lipids that is present in membranes.Lipids adopt defined phases depending on their molecular structure and the physical conditions. In lipid mixtures, two fluid phases can coexist with different physical properties: liquid-disordered and liquid-ordered.Liquid-ordered assemblies in biomembranes, known as lipid rafts, are small and transient but can coalesce and become stabilized during signalling and vesicle budding. How proteins contribute to phase separation and preferentially distribute into one of the two different phases (or at their interface) is presently unclear.},

Giant vesicles provide model biomembrane systems for systematic measurements of mechanical and rheological properties of bilayers as a function of membrane composition and temperature, as well as hydrodynamic interactions. Membrane response to external factors (for example electric fields, ions and amphiphilic molecules) can be directly visualized under the microscope. In this paper we review our current understanding of lipid bilayers as obtained from studies on giant unilamellar vesicles. Because research on giant vesicles increasingly attracts the interest of scientists from various backgrounds, we also try to provide a concise introduction for newcomers in the field. Finally, we summarize some recent developments on curvature effects induced by polymers, domain formation in membranes and shape transitions induced by electric fields.},

The bilayer bending resistance is the resultant of parallel surface compression ``resistances.''The neutral surface is a function of the upper and lower surface compressibility moduli and does not necessarily coincide with the mid-surface. Alterations in the interfacial chemical free energy density (surface tension) on either face can create induced bending moments and produce curvature; even small changes can have a pronounced curvature effect. Chemically induced moments are considered as a possible mechanism for crenation of red blood cells.},

@article{Canham1970,
	abstract = {The membrane of the erythrocyte is assumed responsible for the cell's curious biconcave shape. Combined theoretical and experimental results explain the biconcave shape by the principle of least total curvature of the membrane. This has been interpreted to mean that the energy of bending is minimized. The red-cell membrane is considered uniform over its surface. To accommodate the known viscoelastic properties of the membrane the expression for the bending energy of an element of area, dA, was modified to: dU ∝(1/R12 + 1/R22) dA. R1 and R2 are the principal radii of curvature. The classical equation for the ovals of Cassini was altered to provide an expression for generating hypothetical red-cell profiles. Using the Cassini equation and the bending relation above (ignoring other membrane forces), the energy was determined for many surfaces of revolution having the same area and volume. The geometry and energy of the shape with least energy closely approximated the bending energy and geometry of the actual red-cell profile with the same area and volume. In addition to predicting the geometry of 23 cells in an isotonic medium and nine osmotically swollen cells, the bending hypothesis predicted a swelling sequence for a single cell which was similar to the observed series of Rand (1967). The existence of cup shapes frequently observed in hypotonic media fits within the framework of the bending hypothesis. The concept of bending energy adequately explains the shape of the erythrocyte.},

@article{Fujiwara2002,
	abstract = {The diffusion rate of lipids in the cell membrane is reduced by a factor of 5--100 from that in artificial bilayers. This slowing mechanism has puzzled cell biologists for the last 25 yr. Here we address this issue by studying the movement of unsaturated phospholipids in rat kidney fibroblasts at the single molecule level at the temporal resolution of 25 μs. The cell membrane was found to be compartmentalized: phospholipids are confined within 230-nm-diameter (ϕ) compartments for 11 ms on average before hopping to adjacent compartments. These 230-nm compartments exist within greater 750-nm-ϕcompartments where these phospholipids are confined for 0.33 s on average. The diffusion rate within 230-nm compartments is 5.4 μm2/s, which is nearly as fast as that in large unilamellar vesicles, indicating that the diffusion in the cell membrane is reduced not because diffusion per se is slow, but because the cell membrane is compartmentalized with regard to lateral diffusion of phospholipids. Such compartmentalization depends on the actin-based membrane skeleton, but not on the extracellular matrix, extracellular domains of membrane proteins, or cholesterol-enriched rafts. We propose that various transmembrane proteins anchored to the actin-based membrane skeleton meshwork act as rows of pickets that temporarily confine phospholipids.},

For both receptor species, most of the movement trajectories are of the confined diffusion type, within domains of approximately 0.25 microns2 (500-700 nm in diagonal length). Movement within the domains is random with a diffusion coefficient approximately 10(-9) cm2/s, which is consistent with that expected for free Brownian diffusion of proteins in the plasma membrane. The receptor molecules move from one domain to one of the adjacent domains at an average frequency of 0.034 s-1 (the residence time within a domain approximately 29 s), indicating that the plasma membrane is compartmentalized for diffusion of membrane receptors and that long-range diffusion is the result of successive intercompartmental jumps. The macroscopic diffusion coefficients for these two receptor molecules calculated on the basis of the compartment size and the intercompartmental jump rate are approximately 2.4 x 10(-11) cm2/s, which is consistent with those determined by averaging the long-term movements of many particles. Partial destruction of the cytoskeleton decreased the confined diffusion mode, increased the simple diffusion mode, and induced the directed diffusion (transport) mode. These results suggest that the boundaries between compartments are made of dynamically fluctuating membrane skeletons (membrane-skeleton fence model).},

	abstract = {The physical properties of the lamellar lipid-bilayer component of biological membranes are controlled by a host of thermodynamic forces leading to overall tensionless bilayers with a conspicuous lateral pressure profile and build-in curvature-stress instabilities that may be released locally or globally in terms of morphological changes. In particular, the average molecular shape and the propensity of the different lipid and protein species for forming non-lamellar and curved structures are a source of structural transitions and control of biological function. The effects of different lipids, sterols, and proteins on membrane structure are discussed and it is shown how one can take advantage of the curvature-stress modulations brought about by specific molecular agents, such as fatty acids, lysolipids, and other amphiphilic solutes, to construct intelligent drug-delivery systems that function by enzymatic triggering via curvature.Practical applications: The simple concept of lipid molecular shape and how it impacts on the structure of lipid aggregates, in particular the curvature and curvature stress in lipid bilayers and liposomes, can be exploited to construct liposome-based drug-delivery systems, e.g., for use as nano-medicine in cancer therapy. Non-lamellar-forming lysolipids and fatty acids, some of which may be designed to be prodrugs, can be created by phospholipase action in diseased tissues thereby providing for targeted drug release and proliferation of molecular entities with conical shape that break down the permeability barrier of the target cells and may hence enhance efficacy.},

	abstract = {The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is capable of transducing mechanical stimuli such as membrane tension into an electrochemical response. MscL provides a widely-studied model system for mechanotransduction and, more generally, for how bilayer mechanical properties regulate protein conformational changes. Much effort has been expended on the detailed experimental characterization of the molecular structure and biological function of MscL. However, despite its central significance, even basic issues such as the physiologically relevant oligomeric states and molecular structures of MscL remain a matter of debate. In particular, tetrameric, pentameric, and hexameric oligomeric states of MscL have been proposed, together with a range of detailed molecular structures of MscL in the closed and open channel states. Previous theoretical work has shown that the basic phenomenology of MscL gating can be understood using an elastic model describing the energetic cost of the thickness deformations induced by MscL in the surrounding lipid bilayer. Here, we generalize this elastic model to account for the proposed oligomeric states and hydrophobic shapes of MscL. We find that the oligomeric state and hydrophobic shape of MscL are reflected in the energetic cost of lipid bilayer deformations. We make quantitative predictions pertaining to the gating characteristics associated with various structural models of MscL and, in particular, show that different oligomeric states and hydrophobic shapes of MscL yield distinct membrane contributions to the gating energy and gating tension. Thus, the functional properties of MscL provide a signature of the oligomeric state and hydrophobic shape of MscL. Our results suggest that, in addition to the hydrophobic mismatch between membrane proteins and the surrounding lipid bilayer, the symmetry and shape of the hydrophobic surfaces of membrane proteins play an important role in the regulation of protein function by bilayer membranes.},

We find that the membrane-induced interaction between inclusions varies nonmonotonically as a function of the inclusion spacing. The location of the energy minimum depends on the spontaneous curvature and the membrane perturbation decay length, where the latter is set by the membrane moduli. The membrane perturbation energy increases with the inclusion radius. The Ornstein-Zernike theory, with the Percus-Yevick closure, is used to calculate the radial distribution function of inclusions. We find that when the spontaneous curvature is zero, the interaction between inclusions due to the membrane deformation is qualitatively similar to the hard-core interaction. However, in the case of finite spontaneous curvature, the effective interaction is dramatically modified.},

@article{Huang1986,
	abstract = {The deformation free energy of a lipid bilayer is presented based on the principle of a continuum theory. For small deformations, the free energy consists of a layer-compression term, a splay-distortion term, and a surface-tension term, equivalent to the elastic free energy of a two-layer smectic liquid crystal with surface tension. Minimization of the free energy leads to a differential equation that, with boundary conditions, determines the elastic deformation of a bilayer membrane. When a dimeric gramicidin channel is formed in a membrane of thickness greater than the length of the channel, the membrane deformation reduces the stability of the channel. Previously this effect was studied by comparing the variation of channel lifetime with the surface tension of bilayers (Elliott, J. R., D. Needham, J. P. Dilger, and D. A. Hayden, 1983, Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 735:95-103). The tension was assumed to pull a dimer for a distance z before the channel loses ion conductivity. To account for the data, z was found to be 18 A. With the deformation free energy, the data can be accounted for with z less than or approximately to 1 A, which is consistent with the breaking of hydrogen bonds in a dimer dissociation. Increasing the strength of lipid-protein interactions is not the only consequence of the complete free energy compared with the previous discussions. It also changes the shape of membrane deformation around an embedded channel from convex to concave, and increases the range of deformation from less than 10 A to greater than 20 A. Clearly these will be important factors in the general considerations of lipid-protein interactions and membrane-mediated interactions between proteins. In addition, thermal fluctuations of a membrane are calculated; in particular, we calculate the relations between the intrinsic thickness and the experimentally measured values. The experimental parameters of monoolein-squalene membranes are used for quantitative analyses.},

The basic geometrical variables of the model are the thickness of the hydrophobic region of the lipid bilayer and the length of the hydrophobic region of the proteins. The model incorporates the elastic properties of the lipid bilayer and the proteins, as well as indirect and direct lipid-protein interactions expressed in terms of the geometrical variables. The concept of mismatch of the hydrophobic regions of the lipids and proteins is an important ingredient of the model. The general phase behavior is calculated using simple real solution theory. The phase behavior turns out to be quite rich and is used to discuss previous experiments on planar aggregations of proteins in phospholipid bilayers and to propose a systematic study of synthetic amphiphilic polypeptides in bilayers of different thicknesses. The model is used to interpret the influence of the lipid-protein interaction on calorimetric measurements and on local orientational order as determined by deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance.},

How rafts contribute to cholesterol metabolism and transport in the cell is still an open issue. It has long been known that cellular cholesterol levels are precisely controlled by biosynthesis, efflux from cells, and influx of lipoprotein cholesterol into cells. The regulation of cholesterol homeostasis is now receiving a new focus, and this changed perspective may throw light on diseases caused by cholesterol excess, the prime example being atherosclerosis.},

@article{Bretscher1973,
	abstract = {The arrangement of lipids and some proteins in the erythrocyte membrane has been discussed. The conclusions from this are listed here as a set of general guidelines for the structure of membranes of higher organisms: some of these rules may be wrong. But at this stage it seems useful to sharpen our thoughts in this way and thereby focus attention on various specific points. 1) The basis of a membrane is a lipid bilayer with (i) choline phospholipids and glycolipids in the external half and (ii) amino (and possibly some choline) phospholipids in the cytoplasmic half. There is effectively no lipid exchange across the bilayer (unless enzymatically catalyzed) (68). 2) Some proteins extend across the bilayer. Where this is so, they will in general have carbohydrate on their surface remote from the cytoplasm. This carbohydrate may prevent the protein diffusing out of the membrane into the cytoplasm; it acts as a lock on the protein. 3) Just as lipids do not flip-flop, proteins do not rotate across the membrane. Lateral motion or rotation of lipids and proteins in the plane of the bilayer may be expected. 4) Most membrane protein is associated with the inner, cytoplasmic, urface of the membrane. Proteins are not usually associated exclusively with the outer half of the lipid bilayer. 5) Membrane proteins are a special class of cytoplasmic proteins, not of secreted proteins.},

@article{Deserno2015,
	abstract = {A fluid lipid membrane transmits stresses and torques that are fully determined by its geometry. They can be described by a stress- and torque-tensor, respectively, which yield the force or torque per length through any curve drawn on the membrane's surface. In the absence of external forces or torques the surface divergence of these tensors vanishes, revealing them as conserved quantities of the underlying Euler-Lagrange equation for the membrane's shape. This review provides a comprehensive introduction into these concepts without assuming the reader's familiarity with differential geometry, which instead will be developed as needed, relying on little more than vector calculus. The Helfrich Hamiltonian is then introduced and discussed in some depth. By expressing the quest for the energy-minimizing shape as a functional variation problem subject to geometric constraints, as proposed by Guven (2004), stress- and torque-tensors naturally emerge, and their connection to the shape equation becomes evident. How to reason with both tensors is then illustrated with a number of simple examples, after which this review concludes with four more sophisticated applications: boundary conditions for adhering membranes, corrections to the classical micropipette aspiration equation, membrane buckling, and membrane mediated interactions.},

	abstract = {Currently used pharmaceutical nanocarriers, such as liposomes, micelles, nanoemulsions, polymeric nanoparticles and many others demonstrate a broad variety of useful properties, such as longevity in the blood allowing for their accumulation in pathological areas with compromised vasculature; specific targeting to certain disease sites due to various targeting ligands attached to the surface of the nanocarriers; enhanced intracellular penetration with the help of surface-attahced cell-penetrating molecules; contrast properties due to the carrier loading with various contrast materials allowing for direct carrier visualization in vivo; stimuli-sensitivity allowing for drug release from the carriers under certain physiological conditions, and others. Some of those pharmaceutical carriers have already made their way into clinic, while others are still under preclinical development. What could be seen much more rare, however, are the pharmaceutical nanocarriers combining several from the listed abilities. Long-circulating immunoliposomes capable of prolonged residence in the blood and specific target recognition represent one of few examples of this kind. At the same time, the enginnering of multifunctional pharmaceutical nanocarriers combinig several useful preoperties in one particle can significantly enhance the efficacy of many therapeutic and diagnostic protocols. This paper considers current status and possible future directions in the emerging area of multifunctional nanocarriers with primary attention on the combination of such properties as longevity, targetability, intracellular penetration and contrast loading.},

@article{DrugDelivery2007,
	abstract = {The global set of relationships between protein targets of all drugs and all disease-gene products in the human protein-protein interaction or 'interactome' network remains uncharacterized. We built a bipartite graph composed of US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs and proteins linked by drug-target binary associations. The resulting network connects most drugs into a highly interlinked giant component, with strong local clustering of drugs of similar types according to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification. Topological analyses of this network quantitatively showed an overabundance of 'follow-on' drugs, that is, drugs that target already targeted proteins. By including drugs currently under investigation, we identified a trend toward more functionally diverse targets improving polypharmacology. To analyze the relationships between drug targets and disease-gene products, we measured the shortest distance between both sets of proteins in current models of the human interactome network. Significant differences in distance were found between etiological and palliative drugs. A recent trend toward more rational drug design was observed.},

	abstract = {While mechanobiological processes employ diverse mechanisms, at their heart are force-induced perturbations in the structure and dynamics of molecules capable of triggering subsequent events. Among the best characterized force-sensing systems are bacterial mechanosensitive channels. These channels reflect an intimate coupling of protein conformation with the mechanics of the surrounding membrane; the membrane serves as an adaptable sensor that responds to an input of applied force and converts it into an output signal, interpreted for the cell by mechanosensitive channels. The cell can exploit this information in a number of ways: ensuring cellular viability in the presence of osmotic stress and perhaps also serving as a signal transducer for membrane tension or other functions. This review focuses on the bacterial mechanosensitive channels of large (MscL) and small (MscS) conductance and their eukaryotic homologs, with an emphasis on the outstanding issues surrounding the function and mechanism of this fascinating class of molecules.},

	abstract = {THE ionic channel associated with the acetylcholine (ACh) receptor at the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscle fibres is probably the best described channel in biological membranes. Nevertheless, the properties of individual channels are still unknown, as previous studies were concerned with average population properties. Macroscopic conductance fluctuations occurring in the presence of ACh were analysed to provide estimates for single channel conductance and mean open times1--3. The values obtained, however, depended on assumptions about the shape of the elementary conductance contribution---for example, that the elementary contribution is a square pulse-like event2. Clearly, it would be of great interest to refine techniques of conductance measurement in order to resolve discrete changes in conductance which are expected to occur when single channels open or close. This has not been possible so far because of excessive extraneous background noise. We report on a more sensitive method of conductance measurement, which, in appropriate conditions, reveals discrete changes in conductance that show many of the features that have been postulated for single ionic channels.},

@article{MemReviewRamakrishnan2014,
	abstract = {Biological membranes constitute boundaries of cells and cell organelles. These membranes are soft fluid interfaces whose thermodynamic states are dictated by bending moduli, induced curvature fields, and thermal fluctuations. Recently, there has been a flood of experimental evidence highlighting active roles for these structures in many cellular processes ranging from trafficking of cargo to cell motility. It is believed that the local membrane curvature, which is continuously altered due to its interactions with myriad proteins and other macromolecules attached to its surface, holds the key to the emergent functionality in these cellular processes. Mechanisms at the atomic scale are dictated by protein-lipid interaction strength, lipid composition, lipid distribution in the vicinity of the protein, shape and amino acid composition of the protein, and its amino acid contents. The specificity of molecular interactions together with the cooperativity of multiple proteins induce and stabilize complex membrane shapes at the mesoscale. These shapes span a wide spectrum ranging from the spherical plasma membrane to the complex cisternae of the Golgi apparatus. Mapping the relation between the protein-induced deformations at the molecular scale and the resulting mesoscale morphologies is key to bridging cellular experiments across the various length scales. In this review, we focus on the theoretical and computational methods used to understand the phenomenology underlying protein-driven membrane remodeling. Interactions at the molecular scale can be computationally probed by all atom and coarse grained molecular dynamics (MD, CGMD), as well as dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations, which we only describe in passing. We choose to focus on several continuum approaches extending the Canham - Helfrich elastic energy model for membranes to include the effect of curvature-inducing proteins and explore the conformational phase space of such systems. In this description, the protein is expressed in the form of a spontaneous curvature field. The approaches include field theoretical methods limited to the small deformation regime, triangulated surfaces and particle-based computational models to investigate the large-deformation regimes observed in the natural state of many biological membranes. Applications of these methods to understand the properties of biological membranes in homogeneous and inhomogeneous environments of proteins, whose underlying curvature fields are either isotropic or anisotropic, are discussed. The diversity in the curvature fields elicits a rich variety of morphological states, including tubes, discs, branched tubes, and caveola. Mapping the thermodynamic stability of these states as a function of tuning parameters such as concentration and strength of curvature induction of the proteins is discussed. The relative stabilities of these self-organized shapes are examined through free-energy calculations. The suite of methods discussed here can be tailored to applications in specific cellular settings such as endocytosis during cargo trafficking and tubulation of filopodial structures in migrating cells, which makes these methods a powerful complement to experimental studies.},

Many protein functions are now known to depend on the composition of the membrane. Experiments indicate that biomembranes of eukaryotic cells may be laterally organized into small nanoscopic domains. This inplane organization is expected to play an important role in a variety of physiological functions such as signaling{,} recruitment of specific proteins and endocytosis. However{,} mainly because of their complexity{,} the precise in-plane organization of lipids and proteins and their stability in biological membranes remain difficult to elucidate. This has reiterated the importance of understanding the equilibrium phase behavior and the kinetics of fluid multicomponent lipid membranes. Current increase in interest in the domain formation in multicomponent membranes also stems from the experiments demonstrating liquid ordered-liquid disordered coexistence in mixtures of lipids and cholesterol and the success of several computational models in predicting their behavior. This review includes basic foundations on membrane model systems and experimental approaches applied in the membrane research area{,} stressing on recent advances in the experimental and computational techniques.},

	abstract = {The cell nucleus plays a central role in the response of the endothelium to mechanical forces, possibly by deforming during cellular adaptation. The goal of this work was to precisely quantify the mechanical properties of the nucleus. Individual endothelial cells were subjected to compression between glass microplates. This technique allows measurement of the uniaxial force applied to the cell and the resulting deformation. Measurements were made on round and spread cells to rule out the influence of cell morphology on the nucleus mechanical properties. Tests were also carried out with nuclei isolated from cell cultures by a chemical treatment. The non-linear force--deformation curves indicate that round cells deform at lower forces than spread cells and nuclei. Finite-element models were also built with geometries adapted to actual morphometric measurements of round cells, spread cells and isolated nuclei. The nucleus and the cytoplasm were modeled as separate homogeneous hyperelastic materials. The models simulate the compression and yield the force--deformation curve for a given set of elastic moduli. These parameters are varied to obtain a best fit between the theoretical and experimental data. The elastic modulus of the cytoplasm is found to be on the order of 500N/m2 for spread and round cells. The elastic modulus of the endothelial nucleus is on the order of 5000N/m2 for nuclei in the cell and on the order of 8000N/m2 for isolated nuclei. These results represent an unambiguous measurement of the nucleus mechanical properties and will be important in understanding how cells perceive mechanical forces and respond to them.},

	abstract = {Mechanical properties of the nuclear envelope have implications for cell and nuclear architecture as well as gene regulation. Using isolated Xenopus oocyte nuclei, we have established swelling conditions that separate the intact nuclear envelope (membranes, pore complexes and underlying lamin filament network) from nucleoplasm and the majority of chromatin. Swelling proves reversible with addition of high molecular mass dextrans. Micropipette aspiration of swollen and unswollen nuclear envelopes is also reversible and yields a network elastic modulus, unaffected by nucleoplasm, that averages 25 mN/m. Compared to plasma membranes of cells, the nuclear envelope is much stiffer and more resilient. Our results suggest that the nuclear lamina forms a compressed network shell of interconnected rods that is extensible but limited in compressibility from the native state, thus acting as a {\textquoteleft}molecular shock absorber{\textquoteright}. In light of the conservation of B-type lamins in metazoan evolution, the mechanical properties determined in this investigation suggest physical mechanisms by which mutated lamins can either destabilize nuclear architecture or influence nuclear responses to mechanical signals in Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy, progeria syndromes (premature {\textquoteleft}aging{\textquoteright}) and other laminopathies.},

	abstract = {Abstract The nucleus is the distinguishing feature of eukaryotic cells. Until recently, it was often considered simply as a unique compartment containing the genetic information of the cell and associated machinery, without much attention to its structure and mechanical properties. This article provides compelling examples that illustrate how specific nuclear structures are associated with important cellular functions, and how defects in nuclear mechanics can cause a multitude of human diseases. During differentiation, embryonic stem cells modify their nuclear envelope composition and chromatin structure, resulting in stiffer nuclei that reflect decreased transcriptional plasticity. In contrast, neutrophils have evolved characteristic lobulated nuclei that increase their physical plasticity, enabling passage through narrow tissue spaces in their response to inflammation. Research on diverse cell types further demonstrates how induced nuclear deformations during cellular compression or stretch can modulate cellular function. Pathological examples of disturbed nuclear mechanics include the many diseases caused by mutations in the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A/C and associated proteins, as well as cancer cells that are often characterized by abnormal nuclear morphology. In this article, we will focus on determining the functional relationship between nuclear mechanics and cellular (dys-)function, describing the molecular changes associated with physiological and pathological examples, the resulting defects in nuclear mechanics, and the effects on cellular function. New insights into the close relationship between nuclear mechanics and cellular organization and function will yield a better understanding of normal biology and will offer new clues into therapeutic approaches to the various diseases associated with defective nuclear mechanics. {\copyright} 2011 American Physiological Society.

@article{Singer1972,
	abstract = {A fluid mosaic model is presented for the gross organization and structure of the proteins and lipids of biological membranes. The model is consistent with the restrictions imposed by thermodynamics. In this model, the proteins that are integral to the membrane are a heterogeneous set of globular molecules, each arranged in an amphipathic structure, that is, with the ionic and highly polar groups protruding from the membrane into the aqueous phase, and the nonpolar groups largely buried in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. These globular molecules are partially embedded in a matrix of phospholipid. The bulk of the phospholipid is organized as a discontinuous, fluid bilayer, although a small fraction of the lipid may interact specifically with the membrane proteins. The fluid mosaic structure is therefore formally analogous to a two-dimensional oriented solution of integral proteins (or lipoproteins) in the viscous phospholipid bilayer solvent. Recent experiments with a wide variety of techniqes and several different membrane systems are described, all of which abet consistent with, and add much detail to, the fluid mosaic model. It therefore seems appropriate to suggest possible mechanisms for various membrane functions and membrane-mediated phenomena in the light of the model. As examples, experimentally testable mechanisms are suggested for cell surface changes in malignant transformation, and for cooperative effects exhibited in the interactions of membranes with some specific ligands. Note added in proof: Since this article was written, we have obtained electron microscopic evidence (69) that the concanavalin A binding sites on the membranes of SV40 virus-transformed mouse fibroblasts (3T3 cells) are more clustered than the sites on the membranes of normal cells, as predicted by the hypothesis represented in Fig. 7B. T-here has also appeared a study by Taylor et al. (70) showing the remarkable effects produced on lymphocytes by the addition of antibodies directed to their surface immunoglobulin molecules. The antibodies induce a redistribution and pinocytosis of these surface immunoglobulins, so that within about 30 minutes at 37{\textdegree}C the surface immunoglobulins are completely swept out of the membrane. These effects do not occur, however, if the bivalent antibodies are replaced by their univalent Fab fragments or if the antibody experiments are carried out at 0{\textdegree}C instead of 37{\textdegree}C. These and related results strongly indicate that the bivalent antibodies produce an aggregation of the surface immunoglobulin molecules in the plane of the membrane, which can occur only if the immunoglobulin molecules are free to diffuse in the membrane. This aggregation then appears to trigger off the pinocytosis of the membrane components by some unknown mechanism. Such membrane transformations may be of crucial importance in the induction of an antibody response to an antigen, as well as iv other processes of cell differentiation.},

	abstract = {Thermal fluctuations strongly modify the large length-scale elastic behavior of cross-linked membranes, giving rise to scale-dependent elastic moduli. Whereas thermal effects in flat membranes are well understood, many natural and artificial microstructures are modeled as thin elastic shells. Shells are distinguished from flat membranes by their nonzero curvature, which provides a size-dependent coupling between the in-plane stretching modes and the out-of-plane undulations. In addition, a shell can support a pressure difference between its interior and its exterior. Little is known about the effect of thermal fluctuations on the elastic properties of shells. Here, we study the statistical mechanics of shape fluctuations in a pressurized spherical shell, using perturbation theory and Monte Carlo computer simulations, explicitly including the effects of curvature and an inward pressure. We predict novel properties of fluctuating thin shells under point indentations and pressure-induced deformations. The contribution due to thermal fluctuations increases with increasing ratio of shell radius to thickness and dominates the response when the product of this ratio and the thermal energy becomes large compared with the bending rigidity of the shell. Thermal effects are enhanced when a large uniform inward pressure acts on the shell and diverge as this pressure approaches the classical buckling transition of the shell. Our results are relevant for the elasticity and osmotic collapse of microcapsules.},

Our experiments show that a viscous rope undergoing supercoiling on the impact surface can{,} at times{,} produce a four-branched spiral pattern of bubbles.

Our study provides a very simple method for the generation of mono/bi-dispersed bubbles in viscous fluids at high rates with an ability to tune the bubble size.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, the developments of novel technologies, such as Hi-C or GAM methods, allowed to discover that chromosomes in the nucleus of mammalian cells have a complex spatial organization, encompassing the functional contacts between genes and regulators. In this work, we review recent progresses in chromosome modeling based on polymer physics to understand chromatin structure and folding mechanisms. As an example, we derive in mouse embryonic stem cells the full 3D structure of the Bmp7 locus, a genomic region that plays a key role in osteoblastic differentiation. Next, as an application to Neuroscience, we present the first 3D model for the mouse orthologoue of the Williams--Beuren syndrome 7q11.23 human locus. Deletions and duplications of the 7q11.23 region generate neurodevelopmental disorders with multi-system involvement and variable expressivity, and with autism. Understanding the impact of such mutations on the rewiring of the interactions of genes and regulators could be a new key to make sense of their related diseases, with potential applications in biomedicine.},

@article{Shi:2018uo,
	abstract = {Fingerprints of the three-dimensional organization of genomes have emerged using advances in Hi-C and imaging techniques. However, genome dynamics is poorly understood. Here, we create the chromosome copolymer model (CCM) by representing chromosomes as a copolymer with two epigenetic loci types corresponding to euchromatin and heterochromatin. Using novel clustering techniques, we establish quantitatively that the simulated contact maps and topologically associating domains (TADs) for chromosomes 5 and 10 and those inferred from Hi-C experiments are in good agreement. Chromatin exhibits glassy dynamics with coherent motion on micron scale. The broad distribution of the diffusion exponents of the individual loci, which quantitatively agrees with experiments, is suggestive of highly heterogeneous dynamics. This is reflected in the cell-to-cell variations in the contact maps. Chromosome organization is hierarchical, involving the formation of chromosome droplets (CDs) on genomic scale, coinciding with the TAD size, followed by coalescence of the CDs, reminiscent of Ostwald ripening.},

@article{Falk244038,
	abstract = {The mammalian cell nucleus displays a remarkable spatial segregation of active euchromatic from inactive heterochromatic genomic regions. In conventional nuclei, euchromatin is localized in the nuclear interior and heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery. In contrast, rod photoreceptors in nocturnal mammals have inverted nuclei, with a dense heterochromatic core and a thin euchromatic outer shell. This inverted architecture likely converts rod nuclei into microlenses to facilitate nocturnal vision, and may relate to the absence of particular proteins that tether heterochromatin to the lamina. However, both the mechanism of inversion and the role of interactions between different types of chromatin and the lamina in nuclear organization remain unknown. To elucidate this mechanism we performed Hi-C and microscopy on cells with inverted nuclei and their conventional counterparts. Strikingly, despite the inversion evident in microscopy, both types of nuclei display similar Hi-C maps. To resolve this paradox we developed a polymer model of chromosomes and found a universal mechanism that reconciles Hi-C and microscopy for both inverted and conventional nuclei. Based solely on attraction between heterochromatic regions, this mechanism is sufficient to drive phase separation of euchromatin and heterochromatin and faithfully reproduces the 3D organization of inverted nuclei. When interactions between heterochromatin and the lamina are added, the same model recreates the conventional nuclear organization. To further test our models, we eliminated lamina interactions in models of conventional nuclei and found that this triggers a spontaneous process of inversion that qualitatively reproduces the pathway of morphological changes during nuclear inversion in vivo. Together, our experiments and modeling suggest that interactions among heterochromatic regions are central to phase separation of the active and inactive genome in inverted and conventional nuclei, while interactions with the lamina are essential for building the conventional architecture from these segregated phases. Ultimately our data suggest that an inverted organization constitutes the default state of nuclear architecture.},

@article{Nuebler196261,
	abstract = {Mammalian chromatin is organized on length scales ranging from individual nucleosomes to chromosomal territories. At intermediate scales two dominant features emerge in interphase: (i) alternating regions (\&lt;5Mb) of active and inactive chromatin that spatially segregate into different compartments, and (ii) domains (\&lt;1Mb), i.e. regions that preferentially interact internally, which are also termed topologically associating domains (TADs) and are central to gene regulation. There is growing evidence that TADs are formed by active extrusion of chromatin loops by cohesin, whereas compartments are established by a phase separation process according to local chromatin states. Here we use polymer simulations to examine how the two processes, loop extrusion and compartmental segregation, work collectively and potentially interfere in shaping global chromosome organization. Our integrated model faithfully reproduces Hi-C data from previously puzzling experimental observations, where targeting of the TAD-forming machinery led to changes in compartmentalization. Specifically, depletion of chromatin-associated cohesin reduced TADs and revealed hidden, finer compartments, while increased processivity of cohesin led to stronger TADs and reduced compartmentalization, and depletion of the TAD boundary protein, CTCF, weakened TADs while leaving compartments unaffected. We reveal that these experimental perturbations are special cases of a general polymer phenomenon of active mixing by loop extrusion. This also predicts that interference with chromatin epigenetic states or nuclear volume would affect compartments but not TADs. Our results suggest that chromatin organization on the megabase scale emerges from competition of non-equilibrium active loop extrusion and epigenetically defined compartment structure.},

We constructed spatial proximity maps of the human genome with Hi-C at a resolution of 1 megabase. These maps confirm the presence of chromosome territories and the spatial proximity of small, gene-rich chromosomes. We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes.},

Point mutations in the actin binding domain of those ABPs can tune the association and dissociation dynamics of the actin/ABP bond and thus modulate the network mechanics both in the linear and non-linear response regime. We here demonstrate how the exchange of a single charged amino acid in the actin binding domain of the ABP fascin triggers such a modulation of the network rheology. Whereas the overall structure of the bundle networks is conserved, the transition point from strain-hardening to strain-weakening sensitively depends on the cross-linker off-rate and the applied shear rate. Our experimental results are consistent both with numerical simulations of a cross-linked bundle network and a theoretical description of the bundle network mechanics which is based on non-affine bending deformations and force-dependent cross-link dynamics.},

	abstract = { The actin cortex is a thin cross-linked network attached to the plasma membrane, which is responsible for the cell's shape during migration, division, and growth. In a reductionist approach, we created a minimal actin cortex (MAC) attached to a lipid membrane to correlate the filamentous actin architecture with its viscoelastic properties. The system is composed of a supported 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayer doped with the receptor lipid phosphatidylinositol(4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) to which a constitutively active mutant of ezrin, which is a direct membrane--cytoskeleton linker, is bound. The formation of the MAC on the supported lipid bilayer is analyzed as a function of increasing PtdIns(4,5)P2/ezrin pinning points, revealing an increase in the intersections between actin filaments, that is, the node density of the MAC. Bead tracking microrheology on the membrane-attached actin network provides information about its viscoelastic properties. The results show that ezrin serves as a dynamic cross-linker for the actin cortex attached to the lipid bilayer and that the stiffness of the network is influenced by the pinning point density, relating the plateau storage modulus G0 to the node density of the MAC. },

@article{Heussinger2007,
	abstract = {We study the elasticity of random stiff fiber networks. The elastic response of the fibers is characterized by a central force stretching stiffness as well as a bending stiffness that acts transverse to the fiber contour. Previous studies have shown that this model displays an anomalous elastic regime where the stretching mode is fully frozen out and the elastic energy is completely dominated by the bending mode. We demonstrate by simulations and scaling arguments that, in contrast to the bending dominated elastic energy, the equally important elastic forces are to a large extent stretching dominated. By characterizing these forces on microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic scales we find two mechanisms of how forces are transmitted in the network. While forces smaller than a threshold Fc are effectively balanced by a homogeneous background medium, forces larger than Fc are found to be heterogeneously distributed throughout the sample, giving rise to highly localized force chains known from granular media.},

Because integrins are mechanotransducers that regulate cell fate, we asked whether tissue stiffness could promote malignant behavior by modulating integrins. We found that tumors are rigid because they have a stiff stroma and elevated Rho-dependent cytoskeletal tension that drives focal adhesions, disrupts adherens junctions, perturbs tissue polarity, enhances growth, and hinders lumen formation. Matrix stiffness perturbs epithelial morphogenesis by clustering integrins to enhance ERK activation and increase ROCK-generated contractility and focal adhesions. Contractile, EGF-transformed epithelia with elevated ERK and Rho activity could be phenotypically reverted to tissues lacking focal adhesions if Rho-generated contractility or ERK activity was decreased. Thus, ERK and Rho constitute part of an integrated mechanoregulatory circuit linking matrix stiffness to cytoskeletal tension through integrins to regulate tissue phenotype.},

	abstract = {Migrating cells generate traction forces to counteract the movement-resisting forces arising from cell-internal stresses and matrix adhesions. In the case of collective migration in a cell colony, or in the case of 3-dimensional migration through connective tissue, movement-resisting forces arise also from external stresses. Although the deformation of a stiffer cell or matrix causes larger movement-resisting forces, at the same time a larger stiffness can also promote cell migration due to a feedback between forces, deformations, and deformation speed that is mediated by the acto-myosin contractile machinery of cells. This mechanical feedback is also important for stiffness sensing, durotaxis, plithotaxis, and collective migration in cell colonies.},

	abstract = {Impairment of intestinal epithelial barriers contributes to the progression of HIV/SIV infection and leads to generalized HIV-induced immune-cell activation during chronic infection. Rhesus macaques are the major animal model for studying HIV pathogenesis. However, detailed characterization of isolated rhesus epithelial cells (ECs) from intestinal tissues is not well defined. It is also not well documented whether isolated ECs had any other cell contaminants from intestinal tissues during the time of processing that might hamper interpretation of EC preparations or cultures. In this study, we identify and characterize ECs based on flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry methods using various enzymatic and mechanical isolation techniques to enrich ECs from intestinal tissues. This study shows that normal healthy ECs differentially express HLA-DR, CD23, CD27, CD90, CD95 and IL-10R markers. Early apoptosis and upregulation of ICAM-1 and HLA-DR in intestinal ECs are thought to be the key features in SIV mediated enteropathy. The data suggest that intestinal ECs might be playing an important role in mucosal immune responses by regulating the expression of different important regulatory and adhesion molecules and their function.},

	abstract = {The bacterium Myxococcus xanthus has two motility systems: S motility, which is powered by type IV pilus retraction, and A motility, which is powered by unknown mechanism(s). We found that A motility involved transient adhesion complexes that remained at fixed positions relative to the substratum as cells moved forward. Complexes assembled at leading cell poles and dispersed at the rear of the cells. When cells reversed direction, the A-motility clusters relocalized to the new leading poles together with S-motility proteins. The Frz chemosensory system coordinated the two motility systems. The dynamics of protein cluster localization suggest that intracellular motors and force transmission by dynamic focal adhesions can power bacterial motility.},

@article{LOCK200865,
	abstract = {Cell--matrix adhesion complexes (CMACs) are foci of cellular attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM). This attachment, mediated by integrins and adaptor proteins, provides both physical and regulatory links between the ECM and the cellular microfilament system. Through continual regulation and rearrangement of both ECM adhesion and actin structures, CMACs constitute core machineries of cell migration. To fulfill this role, CMACs are exceptionally flexible and dynamic complexes, and their components undergo rapid and regulated turn-over to maintain delicately balanced streams of mechanical and chemical information. Besides the critical role of CMACs in cell migration, signaling through these complexes provides influence over virtually every major cellular function, including for example cell survival, cell differentiation and cell proliferation. This review depicts the roles of CMACs in cell migration and discusses how CMACs integrate with other sub-cellular systems involved in cell motility. Importantly, we also present a rationalized view of CMACs as information handling machines, and suggest strategies that may facilitate better understanding of the complex cell migration phenomenon as a whole, through quantitative and integrative (systems biology) approaches.},

	abstract = { Focal adhesions (FA) are bidirectional mechanical biosensors that allow cells to integrate intracellular and extracellular cues. Their function is tightly regulated by changes in molecular composition and also by variation in the spatio-temporal dynamics of FA components within this structure. A closely regulated turnover of FA proteins within FA sites allows cells to respond appropriately to their environment, thereby impacting on cell shape and function. FA protein dynamics are linked to FA maturation and rates of assembly and disassembly, and have a significant influence on tumor cell migration. Using the FRAP technique to investigate the hidden internal dynamics of FA, we identified two new regulators of FA dynamics and cell migration: the Mgat5/galectin-3 lattice and tyrosine phosphorylated caveolin-1 (pY14Cav1). In this short review we first introduce FA and their complex dynamic behavior. We then present the Mgat5/galectin-3 lattice and caveolin-1 and discuss their concerted role in FA dynamics, which defines previously unknown, interdependent roles in tumor cell migration. We conclude with a discussion of interesting unexplored avenues that might lead to a better understanding of the complex mechanism of FA dynamics. },

	abstract = { Epithelial tissues represent 60\% of the cells that form the human body and where more than 90\% of all cancers derived. Epithelia transformation and migration involve altered cell contractile mechanics powered by an actomyosin-based cytoskeleton and influenced by cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. A balance between contractile and adhesive forces regulates a large number of cellular and tissue properties crucial for epithelia migration and tumorigenesis. In this review, the forces driving normal epithelia transformation into highly motile and invasive cells and tissues will be discussed. },

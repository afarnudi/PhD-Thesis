	Abstract = {We present an experimental study of liquid rope coiling in order to explore different possibilities of air bubble generation in a viscous fluid. A column of viscous fluid falling on a smooth solid surface exhibits different behaviours{,} e.g.{,} axisymmetric stagnation flow{,} coiling{,} rotatory folding{,} supercoiling{,} etc. These states provide ample opportunity for air to get trapped inside the body of a fluid. We investigate bubble generation mechanisms by studying the instability of a falling fluid rope and the characteristics of the observed bubbles. Our experiments show that a viscous rope undergoing supercoiling on the impact surface can{,} at times{,} produce a four-branched spiral pattern of bubbles. Finally{,} we provide a phase diagram illustrating the bubble properties relevant to the flow rate and fall height of the viscous jet. Our study provides a very simple method for the generation of mono/bi-dispersed bubbles in viscous fluids at high rates with an ability to tune the bubble size.},

	Abstract = {In the last decade, the developments of novel technologies, such as Hi-C or GAM methods, allowed to discover that chromosomes in the nucleus of mammalian cells have a complex spatial organization, encompassing the functional contacts between genes and regulators. In this work, we review recent progresses in chromosome modeling based on polymer physics to understand chromatin structure and folding mechanisms. As an example, we derive in mouse embryonic stem cells the full 3D structure of the Bmp7 locus, a genomic region that plays a key role in osteoblastic differentiation. Next, as an application to Neuroscience, we present the first 3D model for the mouse orthologoue of the Williams--Beuren syndrome 7q11.23 human locus. Deletions and duplications of the 7q11.23 region generate neurodevelopmental disorders with multi-system involvement and variable expressivity, and with autism. Understanding the impact of such mutations on the rewiring of the interactions of genes and regulators could be a new key to make sense of their related diseases, with potential applications in biomedicine.},

@article{Shi:2018uo,
	Abstract = {Fingerprints of the three-dimensional organization of genomes have emerged using advances in Hi-C and imaging techniques. However, genome dynamics is poorly understood. Here, we create the chromosome copolymer model (CCM) by representing chromosomes as a copolymer with two epigenetic loci types corresponding to euchromatin and heterochromatin. Using novel clustering techniques, we establish quantitatively that the simulated contact maps and topologically associating domains (TADs) for chromosomes 5 and 10 and those inferred from Hi-C experiments are in good agreement. Chromatin exhibits glassy dynamics with coherent motion on micron scale. The broad distribution of the diffusion exponents of the individual loci, which quantitatively agrees with experiments, is suggestive of highly heterogeneous dynamics. This is reflected in the cell-to-cell variations in the contact maps. Chromosome organization is hierarchical, involving the formation of chromosome droplets (CDs) on genomic scale, coinciding with the TAD size, followed by coalescence of the CDs, reminiscent of Ostwald ripening.},

@article{Falk244038,
	Abstract = {The mammalian cell nucleus displays a remarkable spatial segregation of active euchromatic from inactive heterochromatic genomic regions. In conventional nuclei, euchromatin is localized in the nuclear interior and heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery. In contrast, rod photoreceptors in nocturnal mammals have inverted nuclei, with a dense heterochromatic core and a thin euchromatic outer shell. This inverted architecture likely converts rod nuclei into microlenses to facilitate nocturnal vision, and may relate to the absence of particular proteins that tether heterochromatin to the lamina. However, both the mechanism of inversion and the role of interactions between different types of chromatin and the lamina in nuclear organization remain unknown. To elucidate this mechanism we performed Hi-C and microscopy on cells with inverted nuclei and their conventional counterparts. Strikingly, despite the inversion evident in microscopy, both types of nuclei display similar Hi-C maps. To resolve this paradox we developed a polymer model of chromosomes and found a universal mechanism that reconciles Hi-C and microscopy for both inverted and conventional nuclei. Based solely on attraction between heterochromatic regions, this mechanism is sufficient to drive phase separation of euchromatin and heterochromatin and faithfully reproduces the 3D organization of inverted nuclei. When interactions between heterochromatin and the lamina are added, the same model recreates the conventional nuclear organization. To further test our models, we eliminated lamina interactions in models of conventional nuclei and found that this triggers a spontaneous process of inversion that qualitatively reproduces the pathway of morphological changes during nuclear inversion in vivo. Together, our experiments and modeling suggest that interactions among heterochromatic regions are central to phase separation of the active and inactive genome in inverted and conventional nuclei, while interactions with the lamina are essential for building the conventional architecture from these segregated phases. Ultimately our data suggest that an inverted organization constitutes the default state of nuclear architecture.},

	Abstract = {Cells can sense and respond to changes in the topographical, chemical, and mechanical information in their environment. Engineered substrates are increasingly being developed that exploit these physical attributes to direct cell responses (most notably mesenchymal stem cells) and therefore control cell behavior toward desired applications. However, there are very few methods available for robust and accurate modeling that can predict cell behavior prior to experimental evaluations, and this typically means that many cell test iterations are needed to identify best material features. Here, we developed a unifying computational framework to create a multicomponent cell model, called the ``virtual cell model''that has the capability to predict changes in whole cell and cell nucleus characteristics (in terms of shape, direction, and even chromatin conformation) on a range of cell substrates. Modeling data were correlated with cell culture experimental outcomes in order to confirm the applicability of the virtual cell model and demonstrating the ability to reflect the qualitative behavior of mesenchymal stem cells. This may provide a reliable, efficient, and fast high-throughput approach for the development of optimized substrates for a broad range of cellular applications including stem cell differentiation.},

Engineered substrates are increasingly being developed that exploit these physical attributes to direct cell responses (most notably mesenchymal stem cells) and therefore control cell behavior toward desired applications. However, there are very few methods available for robust and accurate modeling that can predict cell behavior prior to experimental evaluations, and this typically means that many cell test iterations are needed to identify best material features. Here, we developed a unifying computational framework to create a multicomponent cell model, called the ``virtual cell model''that has the capability to predict changes in whole cell and cell nucleus characteristics (in terms of shape, direction, and even chromatin conformation) on a range of cell substrates. Modeling data were correlated with cell culture experimental outcomes in order to confirm the applicability of the virtual cell model and demonstrating the ability to reflect the qualitative behavior of mesenchymal stem cells. This may provide a reliable, efficient, and fast high-throughput approach for the development of optimized substrates for a broad range of cellular applications including stem cell differentiation.},

@article{Nuebler196261,
	Abstract = {Mammalian chromatin is organized on length scales ranging from individual nucleosomes to chromosomal territories. At intermediate scales two dominant features emerge in interphase: (i) alternating regions (\&lt;5Mb) of active and inactive chromatin that spatially segregate into different compartments, and (ii) domains (\&lt;1Mb), i.e. regions that preferentially interact internally, which are also termed topologically associating domains (TADs) and are central to gene regulation. There is growing evidence that TADs are formed by active extrusion of chromatin loops by cohesin, whereas compartments are established by a phase separation process according to local chromatin states. Here we use polymer simulations to examine how the two processes, loop extrusion and compartmental segregation, work collectively and potentially interfere in shaping global chromosome organization. Our integrated model faithfully reproduces Hi-C data from previously puzzling experimental observations, where targeting of the TAD-forming machinery led to changes in compartmentalization. Specifically, depletion of chromatin-associated cohesin reduced TADs and revealed hidden, finer compartments, while increased processivity of cohesin led to stronger TADs and reduced compartmentalization, and depletion of the TAD boundary protein, CTCF, weakened TADs while leaving compartments unaffected. We reveal that these experimental perturbations are special cases of a general polymer phenomenon of active mixing by loop extrusion. This also predicts that interference with chromatin epigenetic states or nuclear volume would affect compartments but not TADs. Our results suggest that chromatin organization on the megabase scale emerges from competition of non-equilibrium active loop extrusion and epigenetically defined compartment structure.},

	Abstract = {We describe Hi-C, a method that probes the three-dimensional architecture of whole genomes by coupling proximity-based ligation with massively parallel sequencing. We constructed spatial proximity maps of the human genome with Hi-C at a resolution of 1 megabase. These maps confirm the presence of chromosome territories and the spatial proximity of small, gene-rich chromosomes. We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes.},

	Abstract = {Actin binding proteins (ABPs) not only set the structure of actin filament assemblies but also mediate the frequency-dependent viscoelastic moduli of cross-linked and bundled actin networks. Point mutations in the actin binding domain of those ABPs can tune the association and dissociation dynamics of the actin/ABP bond and thus modulate the network mechanics both in the linear and non-linear response regime. We here demonstrate how the exchange of a single charged amino acid in the actin binding domain of the ABP fascin triggers such a modulation of the network rheology. Whereas the overall structure of the bundle networks is conserved, the transition point from strain-hardening to strain-weakening sensitively depends on the cross-linker off-rate and the applied shear rate. Our experimental results are consistent both with numerical simulations of a cross-linked bundle network and a theoretical description of the bundle network mechanics which is based on non-affine bending deformations and force-dependent cross-link dynamics.},

	Abstract = { The actin cortex is a thin cross-linked network attached to the plasma membrane, which is responsible for the cell's shape during migration, division, and growth. In a reductionist approach, we created a minimal actin cortex (MAC) attached to a lipid membrane to correlate the filamentous actin architecture with its viscoelastic properties. The system is composed of a supported 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayer doped with the receptor lipid phosphatidylinositol(4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) to which a constitutively active mutant of ezrin, which is a direct membrane--cytoskeleton linker, is bound. The formation of the MAC on the supported lipid bilayer is analyzed as a function of increasing PtdIns(4,5)P2/ezrin pinning points, revealing an increase in the intersections between actin filaments, that is, the node density of the MAC. Bead tracking microrheology on the membrane-attached actin network provides information about its viscoelastic properties. The results show that ezrin serves as a dynamic cross-linker for the actin cortex attached to the lipid bilayer and that the stiffness of the network is influenced by the pinning point density, relating the plateau storage modulus G0 to the node density of the MAC. },

	Abstract = {We study the elasticity of random stiff fiber networks. The elastic response of the fibers is characterized by a central force stretching stiffness as well as a bending stiffness that acts transverse to the fiber contour. Previous studies have shown that this model displays an anomalous elastic regime where the stretching mode is fully frozen out and the elastic energy is completely dominated by the bending mode. We demonstrate by simulations and scaling arguments that, in contrast to the bending dominated elastic energy, the equally important elastic forces are to a large extent stretching dominated. By characterizing these forces on microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic scales we find two mechanisms of how forces are transmitted in the network. While forces smaller than a threshold Fc are effectively balanced by a homogeneous background medium, forces larger than Fc are found to be heterogeneously distributed throughout the sample, giving rise to highly localized force chains known from granular media.},

	Abstract = {Migrating cells generate traction forces to counteract the movement-resisting forces arising from cell-internal stresses and matrix adhesions. In the case of collective migration in a cell colony, or in the case of 3-dimensional migration through connective tissue, movement-resisting forces arise also from external stresses. Although the deformation of a stiffer cell or matrix causes larger movement-resisting forces, at the same time a larger stiffness can also promote cell migration due to a feedback between forces, deformations, and deformation speed that is mediated by the acto-myosin contractile machinery of cells. This mechanical feedback is also important for stiffness sensing, durotaxis, plithotaxis, and collective migration in cell colonies.},

	Abstract = {Impairment of intestinal epithelial barriers contributes to the progression of HIV/SIV infection and leads to generalized HIV-induced immune-cell activation during chronic infection. Rhesus macaques are the major animal model for studying HIV pathogenesis. However, detailed characterization of isolated rhesus epithelial cells (ECs) from intestinal tissues is not well defined. It is also not well documented whether isolated ECs had any other cell contaminants from intestinal tissues during the time of processing that might hamper interpretation of EC preparations or cultures. In this study, we identify and characterize ECs based on flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry methods using various enzymatic and mechanical isolation techniques to enrich ECs from intestinal tissues. This study shows that normal healthy ECs differentially express HLA-DR, CD23, CD27, CD90, CD95 and IL-10R markers. Early apoptosis and upregulation of ICAM-1 and HLA-DR in intestinal ECs are thought to be the key features in SIV mediated enteropathy. The data suggest that intestinal ECs might be playing an important role in mucosal immune responses by regulating the expression of different important regulatory and adhesion molecules and their function.},

	Abstract = {The bacterium Myxococcus xanthus has two motility systems: S motility, which is powered by type IV pilus retraction, and A motility, which is powered by unknown mechanism(s). We found that A motility involved transient adhesion complexes that remained at fixed positions relative to the substratum as cells moved forward. Complexes assembled at leading cell poles and dispersed at the rear of the cells. When cells reversed direction, the A-motility clusters relocalized to the new leading poles together with S-motility proteins. The Frz chemosensory system coordinated the two motility systems. The dynamics of protein cluster localization suggest that intracellular motors and force transmission by dynamic focal adhesions can power bacterial motility.},

@article{LOCK200865,
	Abstract = {Cell--matrix adhesion complexes (CMACs) are foci of cellular attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM). This attachment, mediated by integrins and adaptor proteins, provides both physical and regulatory links between the ECM and the cellular microfilament system. Through continual regulation and rearrangement of both ECM adhesion and actin structures, CMACs constitute core machineries of cell migration. To fulfill this role, CMACs are exceptionally flexible and dynamic complexes, and their components undergo rapid and regulated turn-over to maintain delicately balanced streams of mechanical and chemical information. Besides the critical role of CMACs in cell migration, signaling through these complexes provides influence over virtually every major cellular function, including for example cell survival, cell differentiation and cell proliferation. This review depicts the roles of CMACs in cell migration and discusses how CMACs integrate with other sub-cellular systems involved in cell motility. Importantly, we also present a rationalized view of CMACs as information handling machines, and suggest strategies that may facilitate better understanding of the complex cell migration phenomenon as a whole, through quantitative and integrative (systems biology) approaches.},

	Abstract = { Focal adhesions (FA) are bidirectional mechanical biosensors that allow cells to integrate intracellular and extracellular cues. Their function is tightly regulated by changes in molecular composition and also by variation in the spatio-temporal dynamics of FA components within this structure. A closely regulated turnover of FA proteins within FA sites allows cells to respond appropriately to their environment, thereby impacting on cell shape and function. FA protein dynamics are linked to FA maturation and rates of assembly and disassembly, and have a significant influence on tumor cell migration. Using the FRAP technique to investigate the hidden internal dynamics of FA, we identified two new regulators of FA dynamics and cell migration: the Mgat5/galectin-3 lattice and tyrosine phosphorylated caveolin-1 (pY14Cav1). In this short review we first introduce FA and their complex dynamic behavior. We then present the Mgat5/galectin-3 lattice and caveolin-1 and discuss their concerted role in FA dynamics, which defines previously unknown, interdependent roles in tumor cell migration. We conclude with a discussion of interesting unexplored avenues that might lead to a better understanding of the complex mechanism of FA dynamics. },

Epithelia transformation and migration involve altered cell contractile mechanics powered by an actomyosin-based cytoskeleton and influenced by cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. A balance between contractile and adhesive forces regulates a large number of cellular and tissue properties crucial for epithelia migration and tumorigenesis. In this review, the forces driving normal epithelia transformation into highly motile and invasive cells and tissues will be discussed. },
